Contrast", "ed with the campaigns which were then shaking all Europe,\nit sank into insignificance; and the world, its eyes strained to see the magni tude and the\nissue of those European wars, little surmised that", " they would dictate the course of history\nfar less than yonder des ultory campaigning in America. Yet here and there a political\nprophet foresaw some of these momentous indirect consequences of the wa", "r.20 THE OLD CONFEDERATION  [1763\n\"England will erelong repent,\" said Vergennes, then the French ambassa dor at\nConstantinople, \"of having removed the only check that could keep her colonies in awe.\nT", "hey no longer stand in need of her protection. She will call on them to contribute\ntoward supporting the burdens they have helped to bring upon her, and they will answer\nby striking off all depen denc", "e.\" This is, in outline, the history of the next twenty years.\nThe war in Europe and America had been a heavy drain upon the treasury of\nEngland. Her national debt had doubled, amounting at the conclu", "sion of peace to\n140,000,000 Pounds sterling. The Government naturally desired to lay upon its\nAmerican subjects a portion of this burden, which had been incurred partly on their\nbehalf. The result wa", "s that new system of taxation which the king and his ministers\nsought to impose upon the colonies, and which was the immediate cause of the\nRevolution. The hated taxes cannot, of course, be traced to ", "the French and Indian War\nalone as their source.1765]  FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR  21\nEngland had for years shown a growing purpose to get revenue out of her American\ndependencies; but the debt incurred by", " the war gave an animus and a momentum to this\npolicy which carried it forward in the face of op position that might otherwise have\nwarned even George III. to pause ere it was too late.\nWhile the war ", "thus indirectly led Eng land to encroach upon the rights of the\ncolonies, it also did much to prepare the latter to resist such encroachment. It had this\neffect mainly in two ways: by pro moting union", " among the colonies, and by giving to\nmany of their citizens a good training in the duties of camp, march, and battle-field.\nThe value to the colonists of their mili tary experience in this war can ha", "rdly be\noverestimated. If the outbreak of the Revolution had found the Americans a generation\nof civilians, if the colonial cause had lacked the privates who had seen hard service at\nLake George and L", "ouisburg , or the officers, such as Washington, Gates, Montgomery,\nStark, and Putnam, who had learned to fight successfully against British regulars by\nfighting with them, it is a question whether the", " uprising would not have been stamped\nout, for a time at least, almost at its inception.22 THE OLD CONFEDERATION  [1765\nEspecially at the beginning of such a war, when the first necessity is to get a ", "peaceful\nnation under arms as quickly as possible, a few soldier- citizens are invaluable. They\nform the nucleus of the rising army, and set the standard for military organization and\ndiscipline. In f", "act, the French and Indian War would have repaid the colonies all it cost\neven if its only result had been to give the youthful Washington that school ing in arms\nwhich helped fit him to com mand the ", "Continental armies. Without the Washington of\nFort Necessity and of Braddock's defeat, we could in all likeli hood never have had the\nWashington of Trenton and Yorktown. Besides Wash ington, to say no", "thing of Gates,\nGage, and Mercer, also there, Dan Morgan, of Virginia, began to learn war in the\nBraddock campaign.1765] FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR  23\nBloody Pond, near Lake George, which is said to still", " contain the\nbones of many of those who fell in the fight at Fort William Henry.24 THE OLD CONFEDERATION  [1765\nAgain, the war prepared the colonists for the Revolution by revealing to them their\nown ", "rare fighting quality, and by showing that the dreaded British regulars were not\ninvincible. No foe would, at Saratoga or Monmouth, see the backs of the men who had\ncovered the redcoats' retreat from ", "the field of Braddock's death, scaled the abatis of\nLouisburg, or brained Dieskau's regulars on the parapet of Fort William Henry.\nBut there was one thing even more nec essary to the Revolutio nists t", "han skill at arms,\nand that was union. Their only hope of successful resistance against the might of\nEngland lay in concerted action, and perhaps the most important result of the long war\nthrough whic", "h they had been pass ing was the sense of union a nd of a com mon cause\nwith which it had inspired the thirteen colonies. This feeling was of course still none too\nintense. But during the long war the", " colonies had drawn nearer to one another than ever\nbefore. Soldiers from New Hampshire and North Caro lina, from Virginia and\nMassachusetts, bivouacked together, and fought shoulder to shoulder. Colo", "nial officers\nforgot local jealousies in a common resentment of the contempt and neglect shown them\nall alike by the haughty subalterns of the king.1765] FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR 25\nMutual good-will was ", "fostered by the money and troops which the southern and less\nexposed colonies sent to their sister commonwealths on the frontier. In these and\nnumberless minor ways a community of sentiment was engend", "ered which, imperfect as\nit was, yet prepared the way for that hearty co-operation which was to carry the infant\nStates through the fiery trial just before them.\nIt is important to remember, as well, ", "not only that the war built up this conviction of\na common interest, but that nothing except the war could have done it. The great forces\nof nineteenth-century civilization-- the locomotive, the teleg", "raph, the modern daily\nnewspaper--which now bind sixty mil lions of people, spread over half a continent, into\none nation, were then unknown. The means of communication and transporta tion\nbetween the", " colonies were very primi tive. Roads were rough, full of steeps and cuts, and\nin many places, especially near cities, almost impassable with mire.26 THE OLD CONFEDERATION [1765\nIt took seven days to ", "go by stage from Philadel phia to Pittsburgh, four days from Boston\nto New York. The mail service was correspondingly inadequate and slow. At times in\nwinter a letter would be five weeks in going from", " Philadelphia to Virginia. The\nnewspapers were few, contained little news, and the circulation of each was neces sarily\nconfined to a very limited area. It has been estimated that the reading-matter i", "n all the\nforty-three papers which existed at the close of the Revolution would not fill ten pages of\nthe New York Herald now. In connection with this state of things con sider the fact that\nthe idea ", "of colonial soli darity had not then, as now, merely to be sustained. It had to be\ncreated outright. Local pride and jealousy were still strong. Each colony had thought of\nitself as a com plete and is", "olated political body, in a way which it is difficult for us, after\na hundred years of national unity, to conceive. Plainly a lifetime of peace would not have\nbegotten the same degree of consolidation", " among the colonies which the war, with its\ncommon danger and common purpose, called into being in a half-dozen years.1765]  FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR  27\nThe war did yet another important ser vice by rem", "oving a dangerous neighbor of the\ncolonies. So long as France, ambitious and warlike, kept foot-hold in the New World,\nthe colonies had to look to the mother-country for protection. But this danger go", "ne,\nEngland ceased to be neces sary to the safety of the embryo political communities, and\nher sovereignty was there fore the more readily renounced. English statesmen foresaw\nthis danger before the P", "eace of Paris, and but for the magnanim ity of Pitt our western\nterritory might after all have been left in the hands of France.\nAnd the cession of Canada, besides re moving an enemy, helped to transf", "orm that\nenemy into an active friend. Had France retained her possessions in America, she would\nstill have had an interest in main taining the colonial system, and it is doubt ful if even her\nhatred o", "f England would have induced her to aid the rebellious colonies. But, her dream\nof a great Western empire forever dispelled, she had much to gain and nothing to lose by\ndrawing sword for the American ", "cause. The British de feated the French at Quebec only\nto meet them again at Yorktown.28 THE OLD CONFEDERATION  [1765\nOne more result remains to be noted, without which what has preceded would lose\nha", "lf its significance. By the Peace of Paris England succeeded to all of France's\npossessions in America east of the Missis sippi; but the most valuable part of this great\nterritory she won only to hold", " in trust a few years for her colonial children. The redcoats\nunder Amherst and Wolfe, who thought they were fighting for King George, were in\nreality winning an empire for the Young Republic. It is n", "ot easy to feel the full\nsignificance of this. The colo nies might, indeed, have won independence even if France\nhad retained her grasp on the valley of the Mississippi; but so long as the new-born\nna", "tion was shut up to a narrow strip along the Atlantic coast, it would have been a lion\ncaged.1765] FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR 29\nThe \"conquest of Canada,\" says Green, \"by … flinging open to their energies ", "in the days\nto come the boundless plains of the West, laid the foundation of the United States.\"CHAPTER II.\nGEORGE III. AND HIS AMERICAN COLONIES\nThe year after the capture of Quebec a young king asce", "nded the throne of England,\nwhose action was to affect profoundly the fortunes of the American colonies. Of nar row\nmental range and plebeian tastes, but moral, sincere, and stout-hearted, George III.", "\nassumed the crown with one dominant purpose--to rule personally; and the first decade\nof his reign was a constant struggle to free himself from the dictation of cabinet\nministers. In 1770, during the", " premiership of North, who was little more than his page,\nthe king gained the day; and for the next dozen years he had his own way perfectly. All\npoints of policy, foreign and domestic, even the manag", "ement of debates in Parlia ment,\nhe was crafty enough to get into his hands. To this meddling of his with state affairs, his\nimpracticable and fickle plans, and the stupidity of the admirers whom his ", "policy forced\nupon him, may be traced in very large measure the breach between England and the\ncolonies.1760] GEORGE III.  31\nThe Revolution, however, cannot be wholly accounted for by any series of e", "vents\nwhich can be set down and labelled. The ultimate causes lie deeper. Three thousand\nmiles of ocean rolled between England and the colonies. A considerable measure of\ncolonial self-government was ", "inevitable from the first, and this, by fostering the spirit of\nindependence, created a demand for more and more freedom. The social ties which had\nbound the early Pilgrims to their native land grew s", "teadily weaker with each new\ngeneration of people who knew no home but America. The colonists had begun to feel\nthe stirrings of an independent national life. The boundless possibilities of the fu tur", "e on\nthis new continent, with its immense territory and untold natural wealth, were be ginning\nto dawn upon them. Their infancy was over. The leading-strings which bound them to\nthe mother-country mus", "t be either lengthened or cast off altogether.32  THE OLD CONFEDERATION  [1760\nKing George III.\nBut England did not see this. Most Englishmen at the beginning of George III.'s\nreign regarded the colon", "ies as trading corporations rather than as political bodies. It was\ntaken for granted that a colony was inferior to the mother-country, and was to be\nmanaged in the interests of the commercial classes", " at home. Conflict was therefore\ninevitable sooner or later. We have to trace briefly the chief events by which it was\nprecipitated.33\nJames Otis, Jr.341764]  GEORGE III.  35\nIn 1760-61 England tried ", "to enforce the navigation laws more strictly. Writs of\nassistance issued, empowering officers to enter any house at any time, to search for\nsmuggled goods. This measure aroused a storm of indignation.", " The popular feeling was\nvoiced, and at the same time intensified, by the action of James Otis, Jr., a young Boston\nlawyer, who threw up his position as advocate-general rather than defend the hated w", "rits,\nwhich he denounced as \"instru ments of slavery.\" \"Then and there,\" said John Adams,\n\"the trumpet of the Revolution was sounded.\"\nIn May, 1764, a report reached Boston that a stamp act for the co", "lonies had been\nproposed in Parliament, to raise revenue by forcing the use in America of stamped forms\nfor all sorts of public papers, such as deeds, warrants, and the like. A feel ing of mingled\nrag", "e and alarm seized the colonists. It seemed that a deliberate blow was about to be\nstruck at their liberties. From the day of their founding the colo nies had never been taxed\ndirectly except by their", " own legislatures. Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island,\nConnecticut, Pennsylvania, and Virginia at once sent humble but earnest protests to\nParliament against the proposed innovation.36 THE OLD CONF", "EDERATION  [1764\nThe act was nevertheless passed in March of the next year, with almost no\nopposition. By its provisions, business doc uments were illegal and void unless writ ten\non the stamped paper", ". The cheapest stamp cost a shilling, the price ranging upward from\nthat according to the impor tance of the document. The prepared pape r had to be paid for\nin specie, a hard ship indeed in a communi", "ty where law suits were very common, and\nwhose entire solid coin would not have sufficed to pay the revenue for a single year.\nEven bit terest Tories' declared this requirement indefensible. An other ", "flagrant feature of\nthe act was the provision that violators of it should be tried without a jury, before a judge\nwhose only pay came from his own condemnations.37\nBurning the Stamps in New York.38176", "5] GEORGE III. 39\nThe effect upon the colonies was like that of a bomb in a powder-magazine. The\npeople rose up en masse. In every  province the stamp-distributor was com pelled to\nresign. In Portsmou", "th, N. H., the newspaper came out in mourning, and an effigy of the\nGoddess of Liberty was carried to the grave. The Connecticut legislature ordered a day\nof fasting and prayer kept, and an inventory ", "of powder and ball taken. In New York a\nbonfire was made of the stamps in the public square. The bells in Charleston, S. C., were\ntolled, and the flags on the ships in the harbor hung at half-mast. Th", "e colo nists entered\ninto agreements to buy no goods from England until the act was re pealed. Even\nmourning clothes, since they must be imported, were not to be worn, and lamb's flesh\nwas abjured tha", "t more wool might be raised for home manufac ture. England's colonial\ntrade fell off so alarmingly in consequence that Man chester manufacturers petitioned\nParliament to repeal the act, asserting that", " nine-tenths of their workmen were idle.40 THE OLD CONFEDER ATION [1765\nBesides these popular demonstrations, dele gates from nine colonies met in New York, in\nOctober, 1765, often called the Stamp Ac", "t Congress, and adopted a declaration of rights,\nasserting that England had no right to tax them without their consent. During the days of\nthe Stamp Act excitement, the term \"colonist\" gave way to \"Am", "erican,\" and \"English\" to\n\"British,\" a term of the deeper opprobrium because Bute, the king's chief adviser, was a\nBriton.\nStartled by this unexpected resistance, Parliament, in January of the next ye", "ar, began\nto debate repeal. We must in fair ness to England look at both sides of the problem of\ncolonial taxation. As general administrator of colonial affairs, the English Government\nnaturally desir", "ed a fixed and certain revenue in America, both for fron tier defence\nagainst Indians and French and for the payment of colonial governors.1765] GEORGE III.  41\nWhile each stood ready to defend its ow", "n territory, the colonies were no doubt meanly\nslow about contributing to any common fund. They were frequently at loggerheads, too,\nwith their governors over the question of salaries. On the other ha", "nd, the colonists made\nthe strong plea that self-taxation was their only safeguard against tyranny of king,\nParliament, or governor.\nIn the great debate which now ensued in Parliament over England's r", "ight to tax\nAmerica, Mansfield, the greatest constitu tional lawyer of his day, maintained --first, that\nAmerica was represented in Parliament as much as Manchester and several other large\ncities in E", "ngland which elected no members to the House of Commons, and yet were\ntaxed; and, second, that an internal tax, such as that on stamps, was identical in principle\nwith customs duties, which the col on", "ies had never resisted.  In reply, Pitt, the great\nchampion of the colonies, asserted-- first, that the case of the colonies was not at all like\nthat of Manchester; the latter happened not to be repre", "sented at that time because the\nelection laws needed reforming, while the colonies, being three thousand miles away,\ncould in the nature of the case never be adequately represented in an Eng lish Parl", "iament;\nand, second, that as a mat ter of fact a sharp distinction had always, since the Great\nCharter, been made between internal taxation and customs duties.42 THE OLD CONFEDERATION [1765\nHad the co", "lonies rested their case upon constitutional argument alone it would have\nbeen relatively weak. While it was then a question, and will be forever, whether the\nAmerican settlements were king's colonies", ", Parliament's colonies, or neither, but pecul iar\ncommunities which had resulted from growth, the English lawyers had a good deal of\nlogic on their side. Unconstitutional measures had indeed been res", "orted to--the writs of\nassistance, taking Americans be yond sea for trial, internal taxation; yet the real\ngrievance lay far less in these things than in the fact that the English constitu tion itself", "\nwas working in a manner contrary to colonial interests. Social considerations, too,\naccounted for more bitterness than has usually been thought. Our fathers hated the\npresence here of a privileged cl", "ass.1765]  GEORGE III  43\nGeorge III.'s policy was therefore wiser legally than politically. This was, in fact, his\nministry's capital mistake--like Lord Salisbury's in respect to Ireland in 1888 --th", "at it had\ntoo great regard for the mere legal aspect of the question, ignoring the practical. The\ncolonists were too numerous, powerful, and far away, longer to be gov erned from home,\nat least by the", " old plan. To attempt perpetuation of the old regime might be lawful, but\nwas certainly impracti cable and stupid. Hence Americans like Jefferson showed\nthemselves consummate politicians in going beyo", "nd Pitt's contention from the\nconstitution and from precedent, and appealing to the \"natural rights\" of the colonists.\n\"Our rights,\" said Otis, in sub stance, \"do not rest on a charter, but are inhere", "nt in us as\nmen.\" \"The people\" said John Adams in 1765, \"have rights ante cedent to all earthly\ngovernment.\"44 THE OLD CONFEDERATION [1767\nThe Stamp Act was repealed in February. Its principle, howeve", "r, was imme diately\nre-asserted by the \"Declaratory Act,\" in which Parliament claimed power over the\ncolonies \"in all cases whatsoever.\" The repeal caused great rejoicing in America; but\nneither king ", "nor Parlia ment had changed policy respecting colo nial affairs. There soon\nfollowed, in rapid succession, that series of blundering acts of oppression which\ncompleted the work begun by the Stamp Act,", " and drove the colonists into rebellion.\nIn 1767 duties were laid upon glass, paper, painters' colors, and tea. Massa chusetts,\nagain taking the lead, sent a circular-letter to all the colonies, propo", "s ing a united\nsupplication to the throne. For refusal to rescind this letter the Mas sachu setts assembly\nwas dissolved at the command of the angry king. This refusal was the first denial of the\nking", "'s preroga tive; only the authority of Parliament had been resisted before. The soul of\nthe colonial cause in Massachusetts at this time was Samuel Adams, of Boston, \"the last\nof the Puritans,\" a man ", "of powerful and logical mind, intrepid heart, and in corruptible\npatriotism.1768] GEORGE III.  45\nAmerica's debt to him for his work in these early years cannot be estimated. At this\njuncture he organ", "ized committees of safety and cor respondence throughout\nMassachusetts, which led to the formation of such com mittees in the other colonies.\nThey did an invaluable work in binding the scat tered sect", "ions together, and providing for\nemergencies.\nThe Billeting Act, which required the colonists to lodge and feed the British troops\nquartered among them, added fuel to the flames. In 1768 the New York ", "legislature\nrefused to comply, and Parlia ment suspended its legislative functions.\nIn the fall of the same year, seizing as a pretext two ship-riots which had occurred in\nthe summer, the king station", "ed four regiments in Boston. Public sentiment was shocked\nand indignant at this estab lishment of a military guard over a peace able community. The\npresence of the soldiers was a constant source of ir", "rita tion.46 THE OLD CONFEDERATION  [1770\nFrequent altercations occurred be tween the soldiers and the lower class of citizens. The\ntrouble culminated in the Boston Massacre of March 5, 1770. A squad ", "of soldiers, set\nupon by a mob of men and boys, fired into the crowd, killing three persons and\nwounding eight others. That the soldiers had considerable justifi cation is proved by the\nfact that a ju", "ry acquitted all but two, who were convicted of manslaughter, and branded.\nBut exag gerated reports of the occurrence spread like wildfire throughout the colonies,\nand wrought powerfully for hatred ag", "ainst England.\nDuring the next two or three years there was comparative quiet. Massachusetts, it is\ntrue, under the tutelage of Samuel Adams, grew more radical in its demands. In 1772 the\ncommittee of", " Boston issued a statement of grievances, adding, as new complaints, the\nsending of persons to Eng land for trial, restraints upon colonial manu facturers, and a\nrumored plan to establish bishops over", " America. This statement was approved by all the\ncolonies, and was sent to Franklin in London. The country as a whole, however, was\nweary of the strife, and would gladly have returned to the old cordi", "al relations with the\nmother-land.1772] GEORGE III.  47\nThe Boston Massacre.\nFrom an Engraving by Paul Revere.48  THE OLD CONFEDERATION [1773\nBut George III. could not rest without asserting his supre", "macy over America. He\nmade an arrangement with the East India Company by which tea could be bought in\nAmerica, spite of the hated tax, cheaper than in England. Then, at the king's in stigation,\nlarge ", "shipments of tea were made to America. The colonists saw through the cunning\nattempt, and the tide of resist ance rose higher than ever. At New York and Philadelphia\nthe tea-ships were forced to put t", "o sea again without unlading. At Charleston the tea was\nstored in damp cellars and soon spoiled. At Boston there was a deadlock; the people\nwould not let the tea be landed; the governor would not let ", "the ships sail without\nunlading. On the evening of December 16, 1773, the tax falling due on the next day, a\nparty of fifty citizens, disguised as Indians, boarded the ships, and threw three hundred\na", "nd forty- two chests of tea into the harbor.1774]  GEORGE III. 49\nThe Boston tea-party aroused all the blind obstinacy of George III. \"Blows must\ndecide,\" he exclaimed; \"the guilty rebels are to be fo", "rced to submission,\" The king's\nanger led to the Boston Port Bill, which was passed the next year, and closed Boston\nharbor to all commerce. Changes were also made in the govern ment of Massachusetts,", "\nrendering it almost entirely independent of the people. Town meetings were forbidden\nexcept for elec tions. Poor Massachusetts, her liberties curtailed,  her commerce ruined,\nappealed to her sister c", "olonies for support, and they responded right heartily. In three\nweeks from the news of the Port Bill all the colo nies had made the cause of\nMassachusetts their own. Expressions of sympathy and liber", "al gifts of money and\nprovisions poured into Boston from all over the country. The first Continental Congress\nassembled at Philadelphia in September. All the colonies but Georgia were represented.\nAn ", "earnest statement of grievances was drawn up, with a prayer to the king for redress.\nThe action of Massachusetts was approved, and an agreement entered into to suspend all\ncommerce with England.50 THE", " OLD CONFEDERATION [1774\nThings now hastened rapidly toward open war. British troops were stationed in\nBoston, and began fortification. Mili tary preparations were making everywhere among\nthe colonist", "s. The train was laid. Only a spark was needed to bring the dreaded\nexplosion.CHAPTER III.\nINDEPENDENCE AND THE NEW STATES\nThe thought of independence in the minds of the colonists was of surprisingly", " slow\ngrowth. The feeling of dependence on the mother-country and of loyalty to the king was\ndeep-rooted and died hard. Even union, which was a pre-requisite to a successful\nstruggle for independence,", " came slowly. The old New England Confedera tion, in 1643-\n84, between Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven, for defence\nagainst Indians, Dutch, and French, ended without ever havin", "g manifested the slightest\nvigor. In the lat ter half of the seventeenth centur y Virginia had alliances with some sister\ncolonies for protection against Indians; but there was no call for a general c", "ongress until\nthe French and Indian attack on Schenectady, in 1690, during King William's War.52 THE OLD CONFEDERATION [1775\nRepresentatives from New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Plymouth met", " that\nyear at New York; letters came from Virginia, Maryland, and Rhode Island. But no\npermanent union was proposed here, nor at any of the similar meetings, seven at least,\nwhich occurred between 169", "0 and 1750.\nThe Albany Convention, which met in 1754 to prepare for the French and Indian\nWar, adopted a plan for union presented by Franklin, providing for a president-general\nappointed and supported", " by the Crown, and for a grand council of delegates elected\ntriennially by the colonies according to population, and empowered, within limits, to lay\ntaxes and make laws for the common interest of Eng", "lish America. Franklin be lieved that\nthe adoption of this scheme would have postponed the Revolution a century. But, as it\ngave so much power to the king, it was rejected by the people in every colon", "y.1775] INDEPENDENCE 53\nEven after English oppression and the diligent agency of committees of\ncorrespondence had brought union, and dele gates from the colonies had met again and\nagain in Congress, t", "he thought of breaking away from the mother-land was strange to the\nminds of nearly all. The instructions to the delegates to the first Congress, in September,\n1774, gave no suggestion of inde pend en", "ce.  On the contrary, colony after colony urged\nits representatives to seek the restoration of \"harmony and union\" with England. This\nCongress branded as \"calumny\" the charge that it wished \" independ", "ency .\" Washington\nwrote, from the Congress, that independence was then not \"desired by any thinking man\nin America.\"\nPine Tree Flag of Massachusetts. Rattlesnake Flag of South Carolina.\n\"AN APPEAL TO", " HEAVEN\" \"DON'T TREAD ON ME\"54 THE OLD CONFEDERATION  [1775\nThe feeling was much the same in 1775. Pennsylvania \"strictly\" commanded her\nrepresentatives to dissent from any \"proposi tion that may lead", " to separation.\" Mary land\ngave similar instructions in January, 1776. Independence was neither the avowed nor the\nconscious object in defending Bun ker Hill, June 17 , 1775. Washington's com mission ", "as\ncommander-in-chief, two days later, gave no hint of it. And the New Hampshire\nlegislature so late as December 25, 1775, in the very act of framing a new state\ngovernment, \"totally disavowed\" all su", "ch aim. In the fall of 1775 Congress de clared that\nit had \"not raised armies with the ambitious design of separation from Great Britain.\"\nThe swift change which, a little more than six months later, ", "made the Declaration of\nIndependence possible and even popular, has never yet been fully explained. In May,\n1775, John Adams had been cau tioned by the Philadelphia Sons of Liberty not to utter\nthe wo", "rd independence. \"It is as unpopular,\" they said, in \"Pennsyl vania and all the\nMiddle and Southern States as the Stamp Act itself.\"1775] INDEPENDENCE  55\nEarly in 1776 this same great man wrote that ", "there was hardly a newspaper in America\nbut openly advocated independence. In the spring of 1776 the conservative Wash ington\ndeclared, \"Reconciliation is im practicable.  Nothing but independence wil", "l save us.\"\nStatesmen began to see that longer delay was dangerous, that per manent union turned\nupon independence, and that, without a government of their own, people would by and\nby demand back thei", "r old constitution, as the Eng lish did after Cromwell's death. \"The\ncountry is not only ripe for independence,\" said Witherspoon, of New Jersey, debating in\nCongress, \"but is in danger of becoming ro", "tten for lack of it.\"\nColony after colony now came rapidly into line. Massachusetts gave instructions to\nher delegates in Congress, virtually favoring independence, in January, 1776. Georgia\ndid the s", "ame in February, South Carolina in March. Express authority to \"concur in\nindependency\" came first from North Carolina, April 12th, and the following May 31st\nMecklenburg County in that State explicit", "ly declared its independence of England. On\nMay 1st Massa chusetts began to disuse the king's name in public instruments. May 4th,\nRhode Island renounced allegiance almost in terms.56 THE OLD CONFEDER", "ATION [1776\nUnion Flag. The first recognized Continental Standard,\nraised for the first time January 2,1776.\nOn May 15th brave old Virginia ordered her delegates in Congress to bite right into the\nsou", "r apple and propose independence. Connecticut, New Hamp shire, Delaware, New\nJersey, and Penn sylvania took action in the same direction during the following month.1776]  INDEPENDENCE 57\nThe king's br", "utal attitude had much to do with this sudden change. The colonists had\nnursed the belief that the king was misled by his ministers. A last petition, couched in\nrespectful terms, was drawn up by Congr", "ess in the summer of 1775, and sent to England.\nOut of respect to the feelings of good John Dickinson, of Penn sylvania, who still clung\nto England, this address was tempered with a submissive ness wh", "ich offended many\nmembers. On its being read, Dickinson remarked that but one word in it displeased him,\nthe word \"Congress;\" to which Colonel Ben Harri son, of Virginia, retorted that but one\nword in", " it pleased him, and that \"Congress\" was precisely the word.\nThe appeal was idle. The king's only answer was a violent proclamation denounc ing\nthe Americans as rebels. It was learned at the same time", " that he was preparing to place\nIndians, negroes, and German mer cenaries in arms against them. The truth was forced\nupon the most reluctant, that the root of England's obduracy was in the king person", "ally,\nand that further supplica tions were useless. The surprising success of the colonial arms,\nthe shedding of blood at Lexington, Concord, and Bunker Hill --all which, remember,\nantedated the Decla", "ra tion--the increase and the ravages of the royal army and navy in\nAmerica, were all efficient in urging the colonists to break ut terly and forever from the\nmother-country.58 THE OLD CONFEDERATION  ", "[1772\nThe behavior of the Gaspe officers in Narragansett Bay, their illegal seizures,\nplundering expeditions on shore, and wan ton manners in stopping and searching boats,\nillustrate the spirit of the", " king's hire lings in America at this time. At last the Rhode\nIslanders could endure it no longer. Early on the morning of June 9, 1772, Captain\nAbraham Whipple , with a few boat loads of trusty aides", ", dropped down the river from\nProvidence to what is now called Gaspe Point, six or seven miles below the city, where\nthe offending craft had run aground the previous evening in giving chase to the\nNew", "port-Providence packet- boat, and after a spirited fight mastered the Gaspe's\ncompany, put them on shore, and burned the ship. There would be much propriety in\ndating the Revolution from this daring a", "ct.1774] INDEPENDENCE  59\nNor was this the only case of Rhode Island's forwardness in the struggle. De cember\n5, 1774, her General Assembly ordered Colonel Nightingale to remove to Providence all\nthe ", "cannon and ammunition of Fort George, except three guns, and this was done before\nthe end of the next day. More than forty cannon, with much powder and shot, were thus\nhusbanded for service to come. N", "ews of this was carried to New Hampshire, and\nresulted in the capture of Fort William and Mary at New Castle, December 14, 1774,\nwhich some have referred to as the opening act of the Rev olution. This", " deed was\naccomplished by fourteen men from Durham, who entered the fort at night when the\nofficers were at a ball in Portsmouth. The powder which they captured is said to have\ndone duty at Bunker Hil", "l.\nMost potent of all as a cause of the resolution to separate was Thomas Paine's\npamphlet, \"Common Sense,\" published60 THE OLD CONFEDERATION  [1776\nin January, 1776, and circulated widely throughout ", "the colonies. Its lucid style, its\nhomely way of putting things, and its appeals to Scripture must have given it at any rate\na strong hold upon the masses of the people. It was doubly and trebly tri u", "mphant from\nthe fact that it voiced, in clear, bold terms, a long-growing popular conviction of the\npropriety of independence, stronger than men had dared to admit even to themselves.\nThomas Paine.177", "6]  INDEPENDENCE  61\nOn June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee, of Virginia, rose in Congress, and, in\nobedience to the command of his State, moved a resolution \"that the united colonies are,\nand of right ou", "ght to be, free and indepen dent States.\" John Adams seconded the motion.\nIt led to great debate, which evinced that New York, New Jersey, Penn sylvania,\nMaryland, and South Carolina were not yet quit", "e ready for so radical a step.\nPostponement was therefore had till July 1st, a committee meantime being appointed to\ndraft a declaration.\nOn July 2d, after further long debate, participated in by John", " Adams, Dickinson,\nWilson, and many other of the ablest men in Congress, not all, even now, favorable to\nthe measure, the famous Declaration of Independence was adopted by vote of all the\ncolonies but", " New York, whose repre sentatives abstained from voting for lack of\nsufficiently definite instructions. We cele brate July 4th because on that day the\ndocument was authenticated by the signatures of t", "he President and Secretary of\nCongress, and published, Not until August 2d had all the representatives affixed their\nnames. Ellery stood at the secretary's side as the various delegates signed, and de", "clares\nthat he saw only dauntless resolution in every eye. \"Now we must hang together,\" said\nFranklin, \"or we shall hang separately.\"62 THE OLD CONFEDERATION  [1776\nThe honor of writing the Declaratio", "n belongs to Thomas Jefferson, of Virginia, who\nwas to play so prominent a part in the early political history of the United States. At this\ntime he was thirty-three years old. He was by profession a ", "lawyer, of elegant tastes, well\nread in literature, deeply versed in political history and philosophy. He was chosen to\ndraft the instrument chiefly because of the great ability of other state papers ", "from his\npen. It is said that he consulted no books during the composition, but wrote from the\noverflowing fulness of his mind.1776] INDEPENDENCE 63\nIt is an interesting inquiry how far the language o", "f the document was determined by\nutterances of a like kind already put forth by towns and counties. There had been many\nof these, and much discussion has occurred upon the question which of them was f", "irst.\nPerhaps the honor belongs to the town of Sheffield, Mass., which so early as January 12,\n1773, proclaimed the grievances and the rights of the colonies, among these the right of\nself-government.", " Mendon, in the same State, in the same year passed resolutions\ncontaining three fundamental propositions of the great Dec laration itself: that all men\nhave an equal right to life and liberty, that t", "his right is inalienable, and that government\nmust orig inate in the free consent of the people. It is worthy of note that the only\nimportant change made by Congress in what Jefferson had prepared was", " the striking out,\nin defer ence to South Ca rolina and Georgia, of a clause reflecting on slavery.64 THE OLD CONFEDERATION  [1776\nCopies of the immortal paper were car ried post-haste up and down the", " land, and\nCongress's bold deed was everywhere hailed with enthusiastic demonstrations of joy.\nThe stand for independence wrought power fully for good, both at home and abroad. At\nhome it assisted vac", "illating minds to a decision, as well as bound all the colonies more\nfirmly together by committing them irreconcilably to an aggressive policy. Abroad it\ntended to lift the colonies out of the positio", "n of rebels and to gain them recognition\namong the nations of the earth.\nLet us now inquire into the political character of these bodies of people which this\nDeclaration by their delegates had erected", " into \"free and independent States.\"\nFive colonies had adopted constitutions, revolutionary of course, before the decisive\nmanifesto. There was urgent need for such action. The few remaining fragments", " of royal\ngovernments were powerless and deca dent. Anarchy w as threatening everywhere. Some\nof the royal governors had fled. In South Carolina the judges refused to act. In other\nplaces, as western ", "Massachusetts, they had been forcibly prevented from act ing. In most\nof the colonies only small parts of the old assemblies could be gotten together.1776]  INDEPENDENCE 65\nNew Hampshire led off with ", "a new con stitution in January, 1776. South Carolina\nfollowed in March. By the close of the year nearly all the colonies had established\ngovernments of their own. New York and Georgia did not formally", " adopt new\nconstitutions until the next year. In Massachu setts a popular assembly assumed\nlegislative and executive powers from July, 1775, till 1780, when a new constitution\nwent into force.

The governors were of course now elected by the people, and they\nsuffered some diminution of power. Legislatures were composed of two houses, both\nelective, no hereditary legislators being", " recognized. All the States still had Sunday laws;\nmost of them had religious tests. In South Carolina only members of a church could\nvote.66 THE OLD CONFEDERATION  [1776\nIn New Jersey an office-holde", "r must profess belief in the faith of some Protestant sect.\nPennsylvania required members of the legislature to avow faith in God, a future state,\nand the inspiration of the Scriptures.

By 1779 England's national debt had\nincreased 63,000,000 pounds; by 1782 it had doubled. Rents were decli", "ning. The price\nof land had fallen one-third. Hence the war became unpopular with the landed\naristocracy. British manufacturers suffered by the narrowing of their foreign markets.\nAmerican privateers,", " prowling in all seas, had captured hundreds of British merchant-\nmen.

The\nold man's portrait was in every house.

With troops inferior in every single ", "respect except natural valor, he out-\ngeneralled Howe in 1776, and he almost never erred when acting upon his own good\njudgment instead of yielding to Congress or to his subordinates.

It\nhad no authority save in tacit general consent. Need of an express and perma nent league\nwas felt at an early date. Articles of Confederation, framed", " by Dick inson, of\nPennsylvania, were adopted by Congress in November, 1777. They were then submitted\nto the State Legislatures for ratification. By the spring of 1779 all the States but\nMaryland had ", "given their approval. Upon the accession of the latter, on March 1, 1781,\nthe articles went into effect at once.1781] THE OLD CONFEDERATION  163\nThe Confederation bound the States together into a \"fir", "m league of friendship\" for\ncommon defence and welfare, and this \"union\" was to be \"perpetual.\"  Each State\nretained its \"sovereignty\" and \"in dependence,\" as well as every power not \"expressly\ndelega", "ted\" to the central Gov ernment. Inhabitants of e ach State were entitled to all the\nprivileges of citizens in the several States. Criminals fleeing from one State to another\nwere to be re turned.\nCon", "gress was composed of delegates chosen annually, each State being repre sented\nby not less than two or more than seven. Each State had but one vote, what ever the\nnumber of its delegates.\nTaxation and", " the regulation of commerce were reserved to the State Governments.\nOn the other hand, Congress alone could declare peace or war, make treaties, coin\nmoney, establish a post-office, deal with Indians ", "outside of the States, direct the army,\nand appoint generals and naval offi cers. Many other things affecting all the States alike,\nCongress alone could do. It was to erect courts for trial of felonie", "s and piracies on the\nhigh seas, and appoint judges for the settlement of disputes between the States. It was to\nmake estimates for national expenses, and request of each State its quota of revenue.16", "4 THE OLD CONFEDERATION  [1781\nTo amend the Articles, the votes of the entire thirteen States were demanded.\nImportant lesser measures--such as those regarding war or peace, treaties, coinage, loans,\n", "appropriations--required the consent of nine States. Upon other questions a majority was\nsufficient. A committee, com posed  of one delegate from each State, was to sit during the\nrecess of Congress, ", "having the general superintendence of na tional affairs.\nThe faults of the Confederation were numerous and great. Three outshadowed the\nrest: Congress could not enforce its will, could not collect a r", "evenue, could not regulate\ncommerce.\nCongress could not touch individuals; it must act through the State Governments,\nand these it had no power to coerce. Five States, for instance, passed laws which ", "vio lated\nthe treaty provision about payment of British creditors; yet Congress could do nothing\nbut remonstrate. Hence its power to make treaties was almost a nullity. Eu ropean nations\ndid not wish ", "to treat with a Government that could not enforce its promises.1781]  THE OLD CONFEDERA TION  165\nCongress could make requisition upon the States for revenue, but had no author ity to\ncollect a single", " penny. The States complied or not as they chose. In October, 1781,\nCongress asked for $8,000,000; in January, 1783, it had received less than half a million.\nLack of revenue made the Government conti", "nually helpless and often contemptible.\nYet in spite of their looseness and other faults, the adoption of the Articles of\nConfederation was a forward step in American public law. Their greatest value ", "was this:\nthey helped to keep before the States the thought of union, while at the same time, by\ntheir very inefficiency, they proved the need of a stronger government to make union\nsomething more tha", "n a thought. The years immediately after the war were an extremely\ncritical period.166 THE OLD CONFEDERATION  [1781\nThe colonies had indeed passed through the Red Sea, but the wilderness still lay bef", "ore\nthem. The great danger which had driven them into union being past, State pride and\njealousy broke o ut afresh. \"My State,\" not \"my country,\" was the foremost thought in\nmost minds.\nThe Franklin P", "enny.\n\"United States\" \"We Are One\"\n\"Fugio\"  \"1787\"  \"Mind Your Business\"\nThere was serious danger that each State would go its own way, and firm union come, if\nat all, only after years of weakness and", " disaster, if not of war. The unfriendly nations of\nEurope were eagerly anticipating such result. At this juncture the Articles of\nConfederation, framed during the war when union was felt to be impera", "tive, did\ninvaluable service. They solemnly committed the States to perpetual union. Their\nprovisions for extradition of criminals and for inter-State citizenship helped to break\ndown the bar riers be", "tween State and State.1783]  THE OLD CONFEDERATION  167   \nCongress, by discharging its various duties on behalf of all the States, kept steadily\nbefore the public mind the idea of a national govern m", "ent, armed with at least a\nsemblance of authority.\nThe war had cost about $150,000,000. In 1783 the debt was $42,000,000--$8,000,-\n000 owed in France and Holland, and the rest at home. The States cont", "ributed in so\nniggardly a way that even the interest could not be paid. Five millions were owing to the\narmy. Deep and ominous discontent spread among officers and men. An obscure\ncolonel, supposed to", " be the agent of more prominent men, wrote to Washington,\nadvocating a monarchy as the only salvation for the country, and inviting him to become\nking. In the spring of 1783 an anonymous address, of m", "enacing tone, was circulated in\nthe army, calling upon it for measures to force its rights from an ungrateful country.168 THE OLD CONFEDERATION  [1785\nThat the army disbanded quietly at last, with onl", "y three months' pay, in certificates\ndepreciated nine-tenths, was due almost wholly to the boundless influence of\nWashington. How powerless the Gov ernment would have been to resist an uprising of\nthe", " army, was shown by a humiliating incident. In June, 1783, a handful of Pennsylvania\ntroops, clamoring for their pay, besieged the doors of Con gress, and that august body\nhad to take refuge in precip", "itate flight.\nThe country suffered greatly for lack of uniform commercial laws. So long as each\nState laid its own imposts, and goods free of duty in one State might be practically\nexcluded from anoth", "er, Congress could negotiate no valuable treaties of commerce\nabroad.\nThe chief immediate distress was from this wretchedness of our commercial\nrelations, whether foreign or between the States at home", ". If our fathers would be\nindependent, king and parliament were determined to make them pay dearly for the\nprivilege. Accordingly Great Britain laid tariffs upon all our exports thither.1785] THE OLD ", "CONFEDERATION 169\nWhat was much harder to bear, an order of the king in council, July 2, 1783, utterly\nforbade American ships to engage in that British West-Indian trade which had always\nbeen a chief ", "source of our wealth.\nDollar of 1794.\nThe First United States Coin.\n\"Liberty\"  \"1794\"  \"United States of America\"\nThe sole remedy for these abuses in dealing with England at that time was retaliation,", "\nbut Congress had no authority to take retaliatory steps, while the separate States could\nnot or would not act sufficiently in harmony to do so. If one imposed cus toms duties,\nanother would open wide", " its ports, filling the markets of the first with British goods by\noverland trade, so that the customs law of the first availed noth ing.170 THE OLD CONFEDERATION [1785\nIf Pennsylvania and New York la", "id tariffs on foreign commodities, New Jersey and\nConnecticut people, in buying im ported articles from Philadelphia or New York, were\npaying taxes to those greater States. North Carolina was in the s", "ame manner a forced\ntributary to South Car olina and Virginia, as were portions of Connecticut and\nMassachusetts to Rhode Island.\nWe also needed a complete system of courts, departments for foreign an", "d Indian\naffairs, and an efficient executive. The single vote for each State was unfair, allowing\none-third of the people to defeat the will of the rest. The article requiring the consent of\nnine Stat", "es made it almost impossible to get important measures through Congress.\nDelegates should not have been paid by their respective States. In consequence of this\nprovision, coupled with other things, Co", "ngress decreased in numbers and importance. In\nNovember, 1783, less than twenty delegates were present, representing but seven States,\nand Congress had to appeal to the recreant States to send back th", "eir representatives\nbefore the treaty of peace could be rati fied.1787] THE OLD CONFEDERATION 171\nBut the one grand defect of the Confederation, underlying all others, was lack of\npower. The Governmen", "t was an engine without steam. The States, just escaped from the\ntyranny of a king, would brook no new authority strong enough to en danger their\nliberties. The result was a thin ghost of a government", " set in charge over a lot of lusty\nflesh-and-blood States.\nThe Confederation, however, did one piece of solid work worthy of everlasting\npraise. The Northwest Territory, embrac ing w hat is now Ohio, ", "Indiana. Illinois,\nMichigan, and Wisconsin, had been ceded to the Union by the States which origi nally\nclaimed it. July 13, 1787, Congress adopted for the government of the terri tory the\nfamous Ordi", "nance of 1787. It provided for a governor, council, and judges, to be\nappointed by Congress, and a house of representatives elected by the people.172 THE OLD CONFEDERATION  [1787\nIts shining excellenc", "e was a series of compacts between the States and the territory,\nwhich guaranteed religious lib erty, made grants of land and other liberal provisions for\nschools and colleges, and forever prohibited ", "slavery in the territory or the States which\nshould be made out of it. Thus were laid broad and deep the foundation for the full and\nfree develop ment of humanity in a region larger than the whole Ger", "man Empire.\nThe passing of the Ordinance was prob ably due in large measure to the influence of\nthe Ohio Company, a colonist society organized in Boston the year before. It was\ncomposed of the flower ", "of the Revo lutionary army, and had wealth, energy, and\nintelligence. When its agent appeared before Congress to arrange for the pur chase of five\nmillion acres of land in the Ohio Valley, a bill for ", "the government of the territory,\ncontaining neither the anti slavery clause nor the immortal principles of the compacts,\nwas on the eve of passage.1787] THE OLD CONFEDERATION 173\nThe Company, composed", " mostly of Massachusetts men, strongly desired their future\nhome to be upon free soil. Their influence prevailed with Congress, eager for revenue\nfrom the sale of lands, and even the Southern members ", "voted unanimously for the\nremodelled ordinance. The estab lishment of a strong and enlightened gov ernment in the\nterritory led to its rapid settlement. Marietta, 0., was founded in April, 1788, and o", "ther\ncolonies followed in rapid succession.CHAPTER X.\nRISE OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION\nThe anarchy succeeding the Revolution was as sad as the Revolution itself had been\nglorious. The Articles of Confeder", "a tion furn ished practically no government with which\nforeign nations could deal; England still clung to the western posts, contrary to the treaty\nof peace, with no power anywhere on this side to do ", "more than protest; the debt of the\nconfederacy steadily piled up its unpaid interest; the land was flooded with irredeemable\npaper money, state and national; the confeder acy's laws and constitution w", "ere ignored or\ntrampled upon everywhere; and the arrogance and self-seeking of the several States\nsurpassed everything but their own contemptible weakness.1787] RISE OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION 175\nIn 178", "6 Shays' rebellion broke out in Massachusetts. Solid money was very scarce,\nand paper all but worthless, yet many debts contracted on a paper basis were pressed for\npayment in hard money. The farmers ", "swore that the incidence of taxes upon them was\nexcessive, and upon the merchants too light. But the all-power ful grievance was the\nsudden change from the distressing monetary injustice during the Re", "volution, with the\nconsequent in crease of debts, to a rigid enforcement of debtors' claims afterward. At this\nperiod men were imprisoned for debt, and all prisons were frightful holes, which one\nwoul", "d as lief die as enter. Meetings were held to air the popular griefs, and grew violent.\nIn August the court-house at Northamp ton was seized by a body of armed men and\nthe court prevented from sitting", ". Similar uprisings occurred at Worcester, Spring field,\nand Concord. The leader in these movements was Daniel Shays, a former captain in the\ncontinental army. Gov ernor Bowdoin finally called for vol", "unteers to put down the\nrebellion, and placed General Lincoln in command.176 THE OLD CONFEDERATION  [1787\nA Scene at Springfield, during Shays' Rebellion, when the\nmob attempted to prevent the holding", " of the Courts of Justice.1787] RISE OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION 177\nAfter sev eral minor engagements, in which the insurgents were worsted, the decisive\naction took place at Petersham, where, in February", ", 1787, the rebels were surprised by\nLincoln. A large number were cap tured, many more fled to their homes, and the rest\nwithdrew into the neighboring States. Vermont and Rhode Island alone offered th", "em a\npeaceful retreat, the other States giving up the fugitives to Massa chusetts.\nThe Shays commotion, for a long time shaking one of the stanchest States in the\nConfederation, well showed the need o", "f a far stronger central government than the old\nhad been or could be made. Other influences concurred to the same convic tion.\nWashington's influence, which took effect mainly through his inspired le", "tter to the States\non leaving the army, was one of these. National feeling was also furthered by the spread\nof two religious sects, the Baptists and the Methodists, up and down the continent,\nwhose mi", "ssionary preachers, ignoring State lines and preju dices, helped to destroy the\nlatter in their hearers.178  THE OLD CONFEDERATION  [1785\nDuring the Revolution, American Methodism had been an appanage", " of England.\nWesley had discountenanced our effort at independence, and when war broke out, all the\nMethodist preachers left the country, save Asbury, who secreted himself somewhere in\nDelaware, waiti", "ng for better days. But in 1784 this zealous body of Christians was\norganized as an American affair, its clergy and laity after this displaying loyalty of the\nmost approved kind.\nJohn Wesley.1785] RIS", "E OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION 179\nSchemes had been mooted looking to a changed political order. A proposition for a\nconvention of the States to reform the Confederation passed the New York Leg islature in", "\nJuly, 1782, under the influence of Alexander Hamilton; another passed that of\nMassachusetts, July, 178$, urged by Governor Bowdoin ; but because of too great love\nfor state independence and too littl", "e appreciation as yet of the serious nature of the crisis,\nboth motions failed of effect.\nThe idea of reform which found most favor, the only one which at first had any\nchance of getting itself realiz", "ed, was that of giving Congress simply the additional power\nof regulating commerce. Even so moderate a proposal as this had many enemies,\nespecially in the South. Greatly to her credit therefore as a ", "Southern State, the purpose of\namending the old Articles in the direction indicated was first taken up in earnest by\nVirginia.180 THE OLD CONFEDERATION  [1785\nHer Legisla ture, soon after opening sess", "ion in October, 1785, listened to memorials from\nNorfolk, Suffolk, Portsmouth, and Alexandria, upon the gloomy prospects of American\ntrade, which led to a general debate upon the subject. In this, Mr.", " Madison, by a speech\nfar exceeding in ability any other that was made, began that extended and memorable\ncareer of efforts for enlarged function in our central government which has earned him\nthe tit", "le of the Father of the Consti tution.\nThe result of this discussion was a bill directing the Virginia delegation in Con gress\nto propose amendment to the consti tution giving to Congress the needed a", "ddi tional\npower. The enemies of the bill, however, succeeded in so modifying it by limiting the\nproposed grant of power to a period of thirteen years, that Madison and its other abettors\nturned again", "st it and voted to lay it on the table.1785]  RISE OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION 181\nThere was in existence at this very time  a joint commission representing Virginia\nand Maryland, which had been raised fo", "r the purpose of determining what jurisdic tion\neach of the two States had over the Potomac and in Chesapeake Bay. Madi son was one\nof the Virginia commissioners. A meeting had been held on March 17, ", "1785, at which\nthe commissioners agreed in their report to transcend their instructions and to\nrecommend to the two States uni form monetary and commercial regulations entire,\nincluding common export ", "and im port duties. They thus reported, adding  the still further\nrecommendation that com missioners to work out the details of such a plan be appointed\neach year till it should be completed. The Mary", "land Legislature adopted the report,\nadding the proposition that Delaware and Pennsylvania also should be invited to enter\nthe system and to send commissioners.\nWhen the commissioners' report, with Ma", "ryland's action thereon, came before the\nVirginia Legislature, Madison moved, as a substitute for the mutilated bill which had\nbeen tabled previously, that the invitation to take part in the commissio", "n go to all the\nStates. The motion passed by a large majority.182 THE OLD CONFEDERATION  [1786\nThus originated the Annapolis Conven tion of 1786. Nine States appointed dele gates;\nall but Connecticut,", " Maryland, and the two Carolinas; but of the nine only Virginia,\nDelaware, Pennsylvania, New Jer sey, and New York actually sent them. As the powers\ngranted the commissioners pre supposed a deputation", " from each of the States, those\npresent, after mature deliber ation, deemed it inadvisable to proceed, drawing up instead\nan urgent address to the States to take \"speedy measures\" for another, fuller,", " convention\nto meet on the second Monday of May, 1787, for the same purposes as had occasioned\nthis one. Such was the mode in which the memorable Federal Convention came about.\nIts seat was Philadelph", "ia.1787]  RISE OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION 183\nThe second Monday of May, 1787, which should have witnessed the opening, was\nthe 14th, but on that day too few deputies had assembled. So late as the 25th on", "ly nine\nStates were represented. They, however, effected an organization on the 25th and chose\nofficers. On the 28th eleven States were present, so that on the next day busi ness began\nin earnest. Gov", "ernor Randolph read and expounded the Virginia plan for a new\ngovernment, and Charles Pinckney the South Carolina plan. Both of these were referred\nto a committee of the whole to sit next day.\nThis Vi", "rginia plan was substantially the work of Madison, and was the earliest sketch\nof the present Constitution of the United States. With the Pinckney plan, it was worked\nover, debated, and amended in the", " committee of the whole, until June 13th, on which\nday the committee rose and reported to the Convention nineteen reso lutions based\nalmost wholly upon the Virginia plan. These were the text for all t", "he subsequent doings\nof the Conven tion.184 THE OLD CONFEDERATION  [1787\nThe so-called New Jersey plan was brought forward on June 15th, the gist of it being\na recurrence to the foolish idea of merely", " repairing the Confederation that then was. Its\nstrength, which was slight, consisted in its accord with the letter of the credentials which\nthe delegates had brought. It was, however, emphatically re", "jected, the Convention\nstretching instruc tions, ignoring the old government, and proceeding to build from the\nfoundations. On July 24th and 26th the resolutions, now increased to twenty-three, were\np", "ut in the hands of a committee of detail to be reported back in the form of a\nconstitution. They reappeared in this shape on August 6th, and this new document was\nhenceforth the basis of discussion. O", "n September 8th a new committee was appointed to\nrevise style and arrange ment, and brought in its work September 13th, after which\nadditions and changes were few. The Constitution received sig nature", " September 17th.1787] RISE OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION  185\nThe Federal Convention of 1787 was the most remarkable gathering in all our\nnational history thus far. Sixty-five delegates were elected, but as", " ten never at tended,\nfifty-five properly made up the body. Even these were at no time all present together.\nFrom July 5th to Au gust 13th New York was not represented. Rhode Island was not\nrepresente", "d at all. Washington was President; Franklin, aged eighty-one, the oldest\nmember; Gillman, of New Hampshire, aged twenty-five, the youngest. Each State sent\nits best avail able talent, so that the for", "emost fig ures then in American political life were\npresent, the chief exceptions being John Adams, Jefferson--both abroad at the time--\nSamuel Adams, not favorable to the Convention, John Jay, and Pa", "trick Henry. Eight of\nthe members had signed the great Declaration, six the Articles of Con federation, seven\nthe Annapolis appeal of 1786. Washington and a good half dozen others had been\nconspicuous", " military leaders in the Revolution. Five had been or still were governors of\ntheir respective States. Nearly all had held important offices of one sort or another. Forty\nof the fifty-five had been in", " Congress, a large proportion of them coming to the\nConvention directly from the congressional session just ended in New York.186 THE OLD CONFEDERATION  [1787\nIt is interesting to note how high many f", "rom this Constituent Assembly rose after the\nadoption of the paper which they had indited. Washington and Madison became\nPresidents, Gerry Vice-President, Langdon senator and President of the Senate, ", "with\nduty officially to notify him who was already First in War that the nation had made him\nalso First in Peace. Langdon was candidate for Vice-President in 1809. Randolph was\nthe earliest United Sta", "tes Attorney-General, Hamilton earliest Sec retary of the Treasury,\nM'Henry third Secretary of War, succeeding General Knox. Dayton was a representative\nfrom New Jersey in the IId, IIId, IVth, and Vth", " Congresses, being Speaker during the\nlast, then senator in the VIth, VIIth, and VIIIth. Ellsworth and Johnson were\nConnecticut's first pair of senators, Johnson passing in 1791 to the presidency of\nC", "olumbia College, Ellsworth to the national chief- justiceship to succeed Jay.1787] RISE OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION 187\nRutledge was one of the first associate justices of the Supreme Court. Subsequently,", " in\nJuly, 1795, Washington nominated him for chief justice, and he actually presided over\nthe Supreme Court at its term in that year; but, for his ill-mannered denun ciation of Jay's\ntreaty, the Senat", "e declined to confirm him. Wilson and Patterson also each held the\nposition of associate justice on the supreme bench of the nation.\nRufus King, after the adoption of the Constitution, removed to New ", "York. He was a\nsenator from that State between 1789 and 1795, and again between 1813 and 1826; and\nMinister to England from 1796 to 1803, and again after 1826 till his failing health\ncompelled his res", "ignation. He was the federalist candidate for Vice-President in 1804\nand 1808, and for President in 1816. Sherman of Connecticut, Gillman of New\nHampshire, and Baldwin of Georgia, went into the House ", "of Representatives and  were\npromoted thence to the Senate.188 THE OLD CONFEDERATION  [1787\nRobert Morris of Pennsylvania, Gouver neur  Morris, now again of New York, Caleb\nStrong of Massachusetts, Wi", "lliam Patterson of New Jersey, Richard Bassett of\nDelaware, Alexander Martin and Blount of North Carolina, Charles Pinckney and Butler\nof South Carolina, and Colonel Few of Georgia, all became senator", "s.

Suggestions were ", "added\nrelating to the mode of launching it. Congress was requested to lay the new Great\nCharter before the States, and, so soon as it should have been ratified by nine of them, to\nfix the date for the", " election by these of presidential electors, the day for the latter to cast\ntheir votes, and the time and place for commencing proceedings under the revised\nconstitution. Congress complied.

In this great State the people were divided almost equally. Of", "\nthe western counties the en tire population that had sympathized or sided with Shays was\nbitter against the Constitution. The larger centres and in general the eastern part of the\nState favored it. T", "he vote was had on Febru ary 6th, and showed a majority of only 19\nout of 355 in favor of the Constitution.\nThe good work still remained but half done. It was a crisis. Accordingly, early in this\nyear", ", Hamilton, Madison, and Jay published their weighty articles, since col lected in the\nimmortal volume known as \"The Federalist.\" These discussions seemed to have much\neffect. Maryland ratified on Apr", "il 28th, and South Carolina on May 23d. New\nHampshire fell into line, the necessary ninth State to ratify, June 21st. Thus the\nConstitution became binding, yet it was still painfully uncertain what th", "e action of\nVirginia and New York would be.192 THE OLD CONFEDERATION [1790\nIn both States the Constitution was opposed by many of the most influen tial men, and\nafter a long and heated can vass adopti", "on occurred i n Virginia by a majority of only ten\nin a vote of 168; in New York by the narrow majority of two. Even now North Carolina\nand Rhode Island remained aloof. The former, not liking the pros", "pect of isolation, came\ninto the Union November 21, 1789, after the new government had been some time at\nwork. Rhode Island, owing to her peculiar history in the matter of religious liberty,\nwhich she", " feared a closer union would jeopardize, as well as to the strength of the paper-\nmoney fanaticism within her bor ders, was mor e obdurate. The chief diffi culty here was\nto get the legislature to cal", "l a convention. The New York Packet of February 20, 1790, in\na letter from Rhode Island, tells how this was accom plished. Among the anti-\nadoptionists in the senate was a rural clergyman who, prompte", "d by his conscience, or, as\none account runs, by exhortation and the offer of a conveyance by an influential member\nof the adoption party, was, when Sunday came, absent upon his sacred work.1790]  RIS", "E OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION  193\nThe occasion was seized for a ballot. The sen ate was a tie, but the Governor threw the\ncasting vote for a convention. This was called as soon as possible, and on May 29", ", 1790,\nRhode Island, too, at the eleventh hour, made the National Constitution her own. Not\nonly had a MORE PERFECT UNION been formed at last, but it included all the Old\nThirteen States.194PART SECO", "ND\nTHE UNITED STATES UNDER THE CONSTITUTION196PERIOD I.\nTHE UNITED STATES AND THE FRENCH REVOLUTION\n1789-1814\nCHAPTER I.\nTHE NEW GOVERNMENT\nNotified on July 2, 1788, that nine States had voted approva", "l of the Constitu tion,\nCongress, on September 13th, set the first Wednesday in January, 1789, for the choice of\nelectors, the first in February for their ballot, and the first in March for putting th", "e new\ngovernment in motion.

Its second session was in Philadelphia, the seat of Congress thence till the\nsecond session of the VIth Con gress, 1800, ", "since which time Congress has always met in\nWashington.\nThe inauguration of our first President was an imposing event. As the hero moved\nfrom his house on Franklin Square, through Pearl Street to Broa", "d, and through Broad to\nFederal Hall, corner of Wall Street, people thronged every sidewalk, door-way, window,\nand roof along the en tire line of march. About him on the platform after his arrival sto", "od\nJohn Adams, Alexander Hamilton, Baron Steu ben, Generals St. Clair and Knox, Roger\nSherman, and Chancellor Livingston. Washington advanced to the rail, placed his hand\nupon his breast, and, bowing ", "low, said audibly, as the Chancellor in his robes solemnly\nrecited the words, \"I swear, so help me God,\" reverently kissing the Bible as if to add\nsolemnity to his oath.1789] THE NEW GOVERNMENT 199\n\"I", "t is done,\" cried the Chancel lor; \"long live George Washington, Pres ident of the United\nStates!\" The great crowd repeated the cry.

By the census of 1790, the population of the thirteen\nStates and of the territory belong ing to the Union numbered 3,929,214. ", "It resided almost\nwholly on the Atlantic coast from Maine to Florida. Not more than five per cent of it was\nwest of the moun tains. The line of inner settlement, now farther, now nearer, ran at an\nave", "rage distance from the coast of two hundred and fifty-five miles.200  THE UNITED STATES  [1789\nThe coast land of Massachusetts, southern New England, and New York was the most\ndensely covered. The Hud", "son Valley was well peopled as far as Albany. Farms and\nhamlets were to be met all the way from New York across New Jersey to the Delaware,\nand far up the Delaware Valley westward from that river. Mai", "ne, still belonging to\nMassachusetts, had few settlements except upon her coast and a little way inland along\nher great rivers. Vermont, not yet a State and claimed by both New Hamp shire an d New\nYor", "k, was well filled up, as was all New Hampshire but the extreme north.\nThe westward movement of population took mainly four routes, the Mohawk and\nOntario, the Upper Potomac, the South western Virgini", "a, and the Western Georgia. The\nMohawk Valley was settled, and pio neers had taken up much land on Lake Ontario and\nnear the rivers and lakes trib utary to it. Elmira and Binghamton had been begun.178", "9]  THE NEW GOVERNMENT  201\nPennsylvania settlers had  pressed westward more or less thickly to the lower elevations\nof the Alleghanies, while beyond, in the Pittsburgh regions, they were even more\nnu", "merous. What is now West Virginia had squatters here and there. Virginian pioneers\nhad also betaken themselves southwestward to the head of the Tennessee. North and\nSouth Carolina were inhabited as fa", "r west as the moun tains, though the population was\nnot dense. In Northern Kentucky, along the Ohio, lay considerable settlements, and in\nTennessee, where Nashville now is, there was another centre of", " civiliza tion. In the\nNorthwest Territory, Detroit, Vincennes, Kaskaskia, Prairie du Chien, Mackinac, and\nGreen River were outposts, at each of which a few white men might have been found.202 THE UNI", "TED STATES  [1789\nThe following table shows pretty nearly the population of the several States about the\nend of the Revolution:\nNew Hampshire                     102,000\nMassachusetts 330,000\nRhode Is", "land [1783] 51,869\n[2,342 of them negroes, 464 mulattoes, 525 Indians.]\nConnecticut [1782] 208,870\nNew York [1786] 215,283\nNew Jersey[1785] 138,934\n[10,500 of them negroes.]\nPennsylvania 330,000\nDelaw", "are 37,000\nMaryland  250,000\n[80,000 of them negroes.]\nVirginia 532,000\n[280,000 of them negroes.]\nNorth Carolina 224,000\n[60,000 of them negroes. ]\nSouth Carolina 188,000\n[80,000 of them negroes.]\nGe", "orgia [rough estimate] 80,000\n[20,000 of them negroes.]\nAnother table exhibits approximately the number of houses in the principal cities of\nthe country in 1785-86.

It had eight hundred and fo", "rty-\nsix names, not going above Roosevelt and Cherry Streets on the East side, or Dey Street\non the West. There were then in the city three Dutch Reformed churches, four\nPresbyterian, three Episco pal", ", two German Lutheran, and one con gregation each\nbelonging to the Catholics, Friends, Baptists, Moravians, and Jews. In 1789 the\nMethodists had two churches, and the Friends two new Meetings. The hou", "ses in the city\nwere generally of brick, with tile roofs, mostly English in style, but a few Dutch. The old\nFort, where the provincial governors had resided, still stood in the Battery. The City Hall\n", "was a brick structure, three stories high, with wings, fronting on Broad Street. Want of\ngood water greatly inconvenienced the citizens, as there was no aqueduct yet, and wells\nwere few. Most houses s", "upplied them selves by casks from a pump on what is now Pearl\nStreet, this being replenished from a pond a mile north of the then city limits. New York\ncommanded the trade of nearly all Connecticut, h", "alf New Jersey, and all Western\nMassachusetts, besides that of New York State itself.1789]  THE NEW GOVERNMENT 205\nIn short it did the importing for one-sixth of the population of the Union. Pennsylva", " nia\nand Maryland made the best flour. In the manufacture of iron, paper, and cabinet ware,\nPennsylvania led all the States.\nOver this rapidly growing portion of the human race in its widely separated", " homes\nthere was at last a central government worthy the name. The old Articles of\nConfederation had been no fundamental law, not a foundation but a homely botch -work\nof superstructure, resembling mo", "re a treaty between several States than a ground-law for\none. In the new Constitu tion a genuine foundation was laid, the Government now\nholding direct and imme diate relations with each subject of ev", "ery State, and citizens of\nStates being at the same time citizens of the United States. Hitherto the central power\ncould act on individuals only through States. Now, by its own marshals, aided if need", "\nwere by its army, it could itself arrest and by its own  courts try and condemn any\ntransgressor of its laws.206 THE UNITED STATES  [1789\nBut if the State relinquished the tech nical sovereignty whic", "h it had before, it did not\nsink to the level of an adminis trative division, but increased rather in all the elements of\nreal dignity and stability. Over certain subjects the new constitu tion gave t", "he States\nsupreme, absolute, and uncontrollable power. The range of this supreme state\nprerogative is, in fact, wider on the whole than that of national. For national action there\nmust be demon strabl", "e constitutional warrant, for that of States this is not necessary. In\nmore technical phrase: to the United States what is not granted is denied, to the State\nwhat is not denied is granted. It is a pe", "rpetual reminder of original state sover eignty, that\nno State can without its con sent be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate. Each\nState also must have at least one representative. States c", "annot be sued by private persons\nor corpora tions. Even upon subjects constitutionally reserved for national law, if\nCongress has not legislated state statute is valid.1789]  THE NEW GOVERNMENT  207\nP", "recisely as its advocates had prophe sied, this revised order worked well, bring ing a\nblessed new feeling of security. On commerce and business it conferred immense\nbenefits, which rapidly became dis", "seminated through all classes of the population. The\nsense and appearance of unity and consequent strength which the land had enjoyed in the\nearly days of the Revolution came back in greater com plete", "ness, and was most gratifying\nto all. There was still a rankling hatred toward England, and men hostile to central\ngovernment on other grounds were reconciled to it as the sole condition of successful", "\ncommercial or naval competition with that country.\nThe consequence was a wide-spread change of public feeling in reference to the\nConstitution very soon after its adop tion. Bitterest hostility turne", "d to praise that was\noften fulsome, reducing to insig nificance an opposition that had probably comprised a\npopular majority during the very months of ratification. Many shifted their ground\nmerely to", " be on the popular side. With multitudes Washington's influ ence had more\nweight than any argument.208 THE UNITED STATES [1789\nThe Constitution's unfortunate elasticity of interpretation also for the ", "time worked\nwell. People who had fought it saw how their cherished views could after all be based\nupon it. All parties soon began, therefore, to swear by the Constitution as their political\nBible. The", " fathers of the immortal paper were exalted into demi gods. Fidelity to the\nConstitution came to be pre-eminently the watchword of those till now against its\nadoption. They in fact shouted this cry lo", "uder than the Federalists, who had never\nregarded it a perfect instrument of government. It came to pass ere long that nothing\nwould blast a public measure so instantly or so com plete ly as the cry o", "f its\nunconstitution ality.Map Showing the Progressive Acquisitions of Territory by the United States1789] THE NEW GOVERNMENT  209\nFew can form any idea of the herculean work performed by the First Co", "ngress in\nsetting up and starting our present gov ernmental machinery. The debt which we owe the\npublic men of that time is measure less. With such care and wisdom did they proceed,\nthat little done b", "y them has re quired alteration, the departments having run on decade\nafter decade till now essen tially in their original grooves. The Sen ate formed itself into\nits three classes, so that one-third ", "of its members, and never more than this, should retire\nat a time. Four executive departments were created, those of State, the Treasury, War,\nand the Attorney-Generalship. The first occupants were, r", "espectively, Jefferson,\nHamilton, Knox, and Randolph.\nOf the present departments of govern ment the post-office alone has come down from\ncolonial times, Benjamin Franklin having been general superinte", "ndent thereof under the\nBritish Government. He was re-appointed by the second Continental Congress, in July,\n1775 . The First Con gress under the Constitution erected a gen eral post-office, but its\nh", "ead attained the dignity of a regular cabinet officer not till about 1830, and then only by\ncustom. To begin with, in fact, there was strictly no cabinet in the modern sense.\nWashington's habit was to", " consult his ministers sepa rately.210 THE UNITED STATES [1789\nUnder the Articles of Confederation there had been a treasury board of sev eral\ncommissioners, and a superintendent of finance. The new a", "rrangement, making one man\nresponsible, was a great improve ment. A law was passed forbidding the Secretary of the\nTreasury to be concerned in trade or commerce, that is, to be a mer chant. The late A", ". T.\nStewart, appointed by President Grant to the office, was re jected as ineligible under this\nlaw. Yet no department of our Government has had a finer record than the Treasury.\nNot only had the Fir", "st Congress to vote revenue, but to make provision for the\ncollection of this. Revenue districts had to be mapped out, the proper officers appointed,\nand light-houses, buoys, and public piers arranged", " for along the whole coast.1789]  THE NEW GOVERNMENT  211\nSalaries were to be fixed, and a multitude of questions relating to the interpretation and\napplication of the Constitution to be solved by pat", "ient deliberation. The United States\nMint was erected, and our so felicitous monetary system, based upon the decimal\nprinciple along with the binary, established in place of the desperate monetary cha", "os\nprevailing before. Hitherto there were four sorts of colonial money of account all\ndiffering from sterling, while Mexican dol lars and numberless other forms of foreign\nmoney were in actual circula", "tion.\nThe noblest part of all this work was the organization of the federal judiciary,\nthrough an act drawn up with extraordinary ability by Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut.\nA Chief Justice--the first", " one was John Jay--and five associates were to constitute the\nSupreme Court. District courts were ordained, one per State and one each for Kentucky\nand Maine, not yet States; also three circuit courts", ", the eastern, the middle, and the\nsouthern; and the jurisdiction of each grade was accurately fixed.212 THE UNITED STATES [1789\nAs yet there were no special circuit judges, nor, excepting the tempora", "ry ones of 1801,\nwere there till some eighty years later. Clerks, marshals, and district-attorneys were part\nof this first arrangement. Originally the Attorney-General was little but an hono rary\noffi", "cer. He kept his practice, had no public income but his fees, and resided where he\npleased.\nAs his title implies, the Secretary of War was to have charge of all the nation's means\nof offence and defen", "ce, there being until April 30, 1796, no separate secretary for the\nnavy. We had indeed in 1789 little use for such a functionary, not a war-vessel then\nremaining in Government's possession. In 1784 o", "ur formidable navy consisted of a\nsingle ship, the Alliance, but the following year Congress ordered her sold.\nThe senators most active in the crea tions just reviewed were Langdon, King, and\nRobert M", "orris, besides Ellsworth. In the House, Madison outdid all others in toil as in\nability, though worthily seconded by distinguished men like Fisher Ames, Gerry,\nClymer, Fitzsimmons, Boudinot, and Smith", ".1789]  THE NEW GOVERNMENT  213\nThe three Connecticut represent atives, Sherman, Trumbull, and Wadsworth, made up\nperhaps the ablest state delegation in the body.CHAPTER II.\nFEDERALISM AND ANTI-FEDERA", "LISM\nEarly in the life of our Constitution two parties rose, which, under various names,\nhave continued ever since. During the strife for and against adoption, those favor ing this\nhad been styled Fed", "eralists, and their opponents, Anti-Federalists. After adoption--no\none any longer really antago nizing the Constitution--the two words lit tle by little shifted\ntheir meaning, a man being dubbed Fede", "ralist or Anti-Federalist according to his\npreference for strong na tional government or for strong state gov ernments. The\nFederalist Party gave birth to the Whig Party, and this to the mod ern Repub", "lican Party.\nThe Anti-Feder alists came to be called \"Republicans,\" then \"Democratic-Republicans,\"\nthen sim ply \"Dem ocrats.\"1790]  FEDERALISM--ANTI-FEDERALISM  215\nThe central plank of the federalist", " plat form was vigorous single nationality. In aid of\nthis the Federalists wished a con siderable army and navy, so that the United States might\nbe capable of ample self-de fence against all foes abro", "ad or at home. Partly as a means to\nthis, partly to build up national feeling, unity, self-respect, and due respect for the nation\nabroad, they sought to erect our national credit, which had fallen so", " low, and to plant it\non a solid and permanent basis. As still fur ther advancing these ends they proposed so to\nenforce regard for the national au thority and laws and obedience to them, that within ", "its\nsphere the nation should be absolutely and beyond question paramount to the State.\nIn many who cherished them these noble purposes were accompanied by a certain\naristocratic feeling and manner, a ", "careless ness of popular opinion, an inclination to\nmodel governmental polity and administra tion after the English, and an impatience with\nwhat was good in our native American ideas and ways, which, ", "however natural, were\nunfortunate and unreasonable.216 THE UNITED STATES [1790\nPuffed up with pride at its victory in carrying the Constitution against the opposition of\nthe ignorant masses, this part", "y developed a haughtiness and a lack of republican spirit\namounting in some cases to deficient patri otism.\nThe early Federalists were of two widely different stripes. There were among them\nWashington", ", Adams, Hamilton, and Jay; and there were the interested and practical\nadvocates of the same, made up of business men and the wealthy and leisurely classes,\nwho, without intending to be selfish, were", " governed in political sympathy and action\nmainly by their own interests.\nThe greatest early Anti-Federalists were Jefferson, Madison, and Randolph, all of\nwhom had been ardent for the Constitution. T", "he party as a whole, indeed, not only\nacquiesced in the re-creation of the general Government, but was devotedly friendly to\nthe new order.1790] FEDERALISM-ANTI-FEDERALISM 217\nBut while Republicans ad", "mitted that a measure of governmental centralization was\nindispensable, they prized the individual State as still the main pillar of our political\nfabric, and were hence jealous of all increased funct", "ion at the centre. It became more and\nmore their theory that the States, rather than the individuals of the national body politic,\nhad been the parties to the Constitution, so making this to be a comp", "act like the old\nArticles, and the government under it a confederacy as before 1789.\nAnother issue divided the parties, that between the strict and the more free\ninterpretation of the Constitution--be", "tween the close constructionists and the liberal\nconstructionists. The question dividing them was this: In matters relating to the powers\nof the general Government, ought any unclear utterance of the ", "Constitution to be so\nexplained as to enlarge those pow ers, or so as to confine them to the nar rowest possible\nsphere? Each of the two tendencies in construction has in turn brought violence to our\n", "fundamental law, but the sentiment of nationality and the logic of events have favored\nliberality rather than narrowness in interpreting the parch ment.218 THE UNITED STATES [1790\nWhen in charge of th", "e government, even strict constructionists have not been able to\ncarry out their theory. Thus Jef ferson, to purchase Louisiana, was obliged, from his point\nof view, to transcend consti tutional warra", "nt; and Madison, who at first opposed such an\ninstitution as unconstitu tional, ended by approving the law which chartered the Second\nUnited States Bank.\nThe Federalists used to argue that Arti cle I,", " Section VIII., the part of the Con stitution\nupon which debate chiefly raged, could not have been intended as an ex haustive\nstatement of congressional powers. The Government would be unable to exist", ", they\nurged, to say nothing of defending itself and accomplishing its work, unless permitted to\ndo more than the eighteen things there enumerated.1790]  FEDERALISM--ANTI-FEDERALISM  219\nThey further ", "insisted that plain utterances of the Consti tution presuppose the exercise by\nCongress of powers not specifically enumerated, ex plicitly authorizing that body to\nmake all laws necessary for executin", "g the enumer ated powers \"and all other powers\nvested in the Government of the United States or in any department or officer thereof.\"\nIn reply the Anti-Federalists made much of the titles \"United Sta", "tes,\" \"Federal,\" and\nthe like, in universal use. They ap pealed to concessions as to the na ture of our system\nmade by statesmen of known national sympathies. Such concessions were plentiful then\nand ", "much later. Even Web ster in his immortal reply to Hayne calls ours a government of\n\"strictly limited,\" even of \"enumerated, specified, and partic ularized\" powers. Two\nhistorical facts told powerfull", "y for the anti-federalist theory. One was that the\ngovernment previous to 1789 was unquestionably a league of States; the other was that\nmany voted for the pres ent Constitution supposing it to be a m", "ere revision of the old.\nHad the reverse been commonly believed, adoption would have been more than\ndoubtful.CHAPTER III.\nDOMESTIC QUESTIONS OF WASHINGTON'S ADMINISTRATIONS\nI. Tariff.-- Upon declaring", " their independence the United States threw open their\nports, inviting trade from all nations. During the Revolution foreign commerce had\nbecome an important interest, and at its close the inclination", " of all, the more so from\nmemory of England's accursed navigation acts, would have been to leave it\nuntrammelled. Several motives, however, induced resort to a restrictive policy which,\nbegin ning wit", "h 1789, and for years expected to be temporary, has been pursued with\nlittle deviation ever since. Of course the Gov ernment needed revenue, and the readiest\nmeans of securing this was a tax on import", "s. Rates were made low, averaging until 1808\nonly 11-1/4 per cent. As a consequence the revenues were large.1790] WASHINGTON'S ADMINISTRATIONS 221\nThe movers of this first tariff, especially Hamilton,", " also wished by means of it to\nmake the central Government felt as a posi tive power throughout the land. It had this\neffect. All custom-houses passed to the United States, and United States officers\n", "appeared at every port, having an authority, in its kind, paramount to that of state\nfunctionaries.\nA stronger consideration still was to re taliate against England. In spite of Amer ica's\npolitical i", "ndependence the old country was determined to retain for her merchant marine\nits former monopoly here. Orders in council practically limited all the com merce of\nEngland and her remaining colo nies wi", "th this country to English ships, although, from\nthe relations of the two lands and the nature of their productions, our chief foreign trade\nmust still be with England. There was no way to meet this s", "elfish policy but to show that\nit was a game which we too could play.222 THE UNITED STATES [1790\nBesides, however we behaved toward the mother-land, we needed to be prepared for\nwar, because it was ev", "ident that George III. and his ministers had only too good a will to\nreduce us again to subjection if opportunity offered. Should we, by taxing imports,\nbecome independent in the pro duction of war ma", "terial, a fresh struggle for life would be\nmuch more hopeful than if we continued dependent upon foreign lands for military\nsupplies.\nII. Funding the Debt .--In the first years after they had set up t", "heir new constitu tion\nthe people of this country staggered under a terrible financial load. Besides the current\nexpenses of Government, there were: 1, the federal debt due abroad, over thirteen\nmilli", "on dollars, including arrears; 2, the federal debt held at home, about forty-two and\none-half million; 3, the state revolutionary debts, aggregating nearly twenty-five million.\nEach of these sums was ", "largely made up of unpaid interest.1790] WASHINGTON'S ADMINISTRATIONS  223\nThe foreign debt Congress unanimously determined to pay in full. In respect to the\ndomestic federal debt two opinions prevail", "ed. Hamilton was for liquidating this also to\nthe last copper. But these securities had mostly changed hands since issue, so that dollar\nfor dollar payment would not advantage original holders but onl", "y speculators. As soon\nas Hamilton's recommendation became public this class of paper rose from about fifteen\ncents per dollar to fifty cents, and enterprising New York firms hurried their couriers,\nr", "elay horses, and swift packets to remote parts of the Union to buy it up. Madison,\nsupported by a strong party, proposed, there fore, to pay only original debtors  at par,\nallowing secondary holders b", "arely the high est market value previous to the opening of\nthe question in Congress. He was over ruled, however, and this part of the debt, too, was\nordered paid according to its lit eral terms.224 TH", "E UNITED STATES  [1790\nEven the motion that the United States should assume and discharge the state debts\nfinally prevailed, though against most violent and resolute opposition. This came\nespecially f", "rom Virginia, who had gone far in the payment of her own war debt, and\nthought it unjust to have to help the delinquent States. Her objection was strengthened by\nthe fact that most of the debt was own", "ed in the North. The vic tory was secured by what\nis now termed a \"deal,\" northern votes being promised in favor of a southern location for\nthe na tional capital, in return for enough south ern votes ", "to pass the bill assuming state\ndebts.\nThese gigantic measures had origin in the mind of Hamilton. To many they appeared\nand appear today like a grand government job. But they worked well, laying the\n", "foundation of our national credit. Interest arrears and back install ments of the foreign\ndebt were to be paid at once with the proceeds of a fresh loan, supplemented by income\nfrom customs and tonnag", "e. The remaining debt was to be refunded. Federal stocks shot\nup in value, moneyed interests became attached to the Government, and the nation began\nto be  looked to as a more reliable bulwark of soun", "d finance than any of the States.225\nAlexander Hamilton.\nFrom a painting by John Trumbull in the Trumbull Gallery at Yale College.2261791] WASHINGTON'S ADMINISTRATIONS  227\nIII. The Excise.-- Unexpect", "edly  produc tive as the tariff had proved, public income\nstill fell short of what these vast operations required. Direct taxation or a higher tariff\nbeing out of the question, Hamilton pro posed, and", " Congress voted, an excise on spirits,\nfrom nine to twenty-five cents a gallon if from grain, from eleven to thirty if from\nimported material, as molasses. Excise was a hated form of tax, and this mea", "sure\nawakened great opposition in Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and New England,\nand most of all in Pennsyl vania, in whose western counties distilling was the staple\nindustry.\nHere, far from th", "e seats of power, even the state government had asserted itself lit tle.\nThe general Government was defied. A meeting in Washington County voted to regard\nas an enemy any person taking office under th", "e excise law. September 6, 1791, a\nrevenue officer was tarred and feathered. Other such cases followed. Secret societies\nwere formed to oppose the law. Whip pings and even murders resulted. At last th", "ere was\na veritable reign of terror.

A\nfar deeper motive with the more thoughtful was the belief that neutrality violated", " our\ntreaty of 1778 with France, a conclusion at present beyond question.

Pro visions owned by\nAmericans and en route to England were al", "so to be forfeited as contraband. Even the\nmost reasonable French officials seemed bent on treating our country as a dependency of\nFrance.1793] THE FRENCH REPUBLIC 247\nWe see this in the actions of Ge", "net, the first envoy to America from the French\nconstitutional monarchy, accredited hither by a ministry of high-minded Republicans\nwhile Louis XVI. still sat upon his throne. Genet arrived in Charles", "ton in 1793, before\nour neutrality had been proclaimed. Imme diately, before presenting his credentials to our\nGovernment, he set about fitting out privateers, manning them with Americans, and\nsending", " them to prey upon British ships, some of which they captured in American\nwaters. All this was in utter derogation of the treaty, which only guar anteed shelter to\nbona fide French vessels. Under a la", "w of the French National Con vention, Genet\nassumed to erect the French consulates in this country into so many admiralty courts for\nthe trial of British prizes. We could not have allowed this without", " decidedly violating\ninternational law at least in spirit. He also devised and partly arranged expeditions of\nAmericans, to start, one from Georgia to invade Flor ida, another from Kentucky to\ncapture", "  New Orleans, both as means of weakening Spain, which up to this time and for\nseveral years later was France's foe.248 THE UNITED STATES  [1795\nBut Genet's worst gall came out in his conduct toward W", "ashington.

The insolence o", "f the French Government waxed insuf ferable.

These were esp", "ecially\ndirected against refugees from France, lest they should attempt to re enact here the\nbloody drama just played out there. Combinations were alleged, without proof, to exist\nbetween American and", " French democrats, dangerous to the stability of this Government.\nA new naturalization act was passed, requiring of an immigrant, as prerequisite to\ncitizenship, fourteen years of residence instead of", " the five heretofore sufficient. Next\ncame three alien acts, empowering the President, at his discretion, without trial or even a\nstatement of his reasons, to banish foreigners from the land; any who ", "should return\nunbidden being liable to imprisonment for three years, and cut off from the possibility of\ncitizenship forever.1797] THE FEDERALIST PARTY  257\nA \"sedition act\" followed, to fine in the s", "um of $5,000 each and to imprison for five\nyears any persons stirring up sedition, combining to oppose govern mental measures,\nresisting United States law, or putting forth \"any false, scandalous, or ", "malicious\nwritings\" against Congress, the President, or the Government.\nTo President Adams's credit, he was no abettor of these hateful decrees, and did little\nto enforce them. The sedition law, howev", "er, did not rest with him for exe cution, and was\napplied right and left. Evidently its champions were swayed largely by political motives.\nMatthew Lyon, a fiery Republican member of Con gress from Ve", "rmont, had, in an\naddress to his constituents, charged the President with avarice and with \"thirst for\nridiculous pomp and foolish adulation,\" He was convicted of sedition, fined $1,000, and\nsentenced", " to four months in prison. This impoverished him, as well as took him from his\nplace in Congress for most of a session. Adams refused pardon, but in 1840 Congress\npaid back the fine to Lyon's heirs.25", "8 THE UNITED STATES  [1797\nIt is now admitted that these measures were unconstitutional, as invading freedom of\nspeech and of the press, and assigning to the Federal Judiciary a common-law\njurisdictio", "n in criminal matters. But they were also highly unwise, subjecting the\nFederalist Party to the odium of fearing free speech, of declining a discussion of its\npolicy, and of hating foreigners. The lea", "st opposition to the party in power, or criticism\nof its official chiefs, became crim inal, under the head of \"opposing\" the Government. A\njoke or a caricature might send its author to jail as \"sediti", "ous.\" It was surely a travesty\nupon liberty when a man could be arrested for expressing the wish, as a salute was fired,\nthat the wadding might hit John Adams behind. Even libels upon government, if i", "t is to\nbe genuinely free, must be ignored--a principle now acted upon by all constitu tional\nStates.1797] THE FEDERALIST PARTY 259\nBut the Federalists were blind to con siderations like these. As Sch", "ouler  well\nremarks: \"A sort of photophobia afflicted statesmen, who, allowing little for the good\nsense and spirit of Americans, or our geo graphical disconnection  with France, were\ncrazed with the ", "fear that this Union might be, like Venice, made over to some Euro pean\npotentate, or chained in the same galley with Switzerland or Holland, to do the\nDirectory's bidding. That, besides this unfounde", "d fear, operated the desire of ultra-\nFederalists to take revenge upon those presses which had assailed the British treaty and\nother pet measures, and abused Federal leaders; and the deter mination to", " entrench\nthemselves in author ity by forcibly disbanding an opposition party which attracted a\nreadier support at the polls from the oppressed of other countries, no candid writer can at\nthis day que", "stion.”260 THE UNITED STATES [1798\nIt was next the turn of the Republicans to blunder. In November, 1798, the Ken tucky\nLegislature passed a series of reso lutions, drawn up by John Breckenridge upon ", "a sketch\nby Jefferson, in effect de claring the alien and sedition acts not law, but altogether void\nand of no force. In December the Virginia Legislature put forth a similar series by\nMadison, milder", " in tone and more cautiously expressed, denouncing those acts as\n\"palpable and alarming infractions of the Constitution.\" A year after their first utterance,\nthe Ken tucky law-makers further \"resolved", " that the several States who formed (th e\nConstitution), being sovereign and indepen dent, have the unquestionable right to judge\nof its infraction; and that a nullifi cation by those sovereignties, o", "f all un authorized acts\ndone under color of that instrument, is the rightful remedy.\" Vir ginia  again declared it a\nState's right \"to interpose\" in such cases.1798]  THE FEDERALIST PARTY 261\nThese r", "esolutions were intended to stir reflection and influence opinion, and, if\npossible, elicit a concurrent request to Congress from the various States to repeal the\nobnoxious acts. They do not hint at t", "he use of force. Their execration of the hated laws is\nnone too strong, and their argument as a whole is masterly and un answerable. But at\nleast those of Ken tucky suggest, if they do not contain, a ", "do ctrine respecting the\nConstitution which is untenable and baneful, in kernel the same that threatened secession\nin Jack son's time and brought it in Buchanan's. The State, as such, is not a party t", "o the\nConstitution. Still less is the Legislature. Nor is either, but the Supreme Court, the judge\nwhether in any case the fundamental law has been infringed.\nProcuring the resolutions, however, prove", "d a crafty political move. The enor mity of\nthe despicable acts was advertised as never before, while the endorsement of them by\nfederalist legislators went upon record. Petitions for repeal came in s", "o numerous and\nnumerously signed that the VIth Congress could not but raise a committee to consider\nsuch action. It reported adversely, and the report was accepted, the majority in the\nHouse, fifty- t", "wo to forty-eight, trying contemptuously to cough down  every speaker\nlifting his voice on the opposite side.262 THE UNITED STATES  [1799\nThis sullen obstinacy in favor of a mis erable experiment seal", "ed the doom of\nFederalism. In vain did the party orators plead that liberty of speech and the press is not\nlicense, but only the right to utter \"the truth,\" that hence this liberty was not abridged by", "\nthe acts in question, and that aliens had no constitutional rights, but enjoyed the\nprivileges of the land only by favor. The fact remained, more and more appreciated by\nordinary people, that a land ", "ruled by such maxims could never be free.\nSo a deep distrust of Federalism sprung up, as out of sympathy with popular\ngovernment. It was furthered by the attach ment of prominent Federalists to Englan", "d.\nSeveral of them are on record as ready to involve the United States in an expedition\nplanned by one Miranda, to conquer Span ish America in aid of Great Britain, Spain and\nourselves being perfectly", " at peace.1799] THE FEDERALIST PARTY  263\nThe federalist chieftains were too proud, ignoring too much the common voter. They\noften expressed doubt, too, as to the permanence of popular institutions. F", "ederalism had\ntoo close affinity with Puritanism to suit many outside New Eng land. And then--deadly\nto the party even had nothing else concurred--there was a quarrel among its leaders.\nHamilton, the ", "Essex Junto ( Pickering, Cabot, Quincy, Otis), and their supporters were\nset against Adams and his friends. This rivalry of long standing was brought to a head by\nAdams's noble and self-sacrificing in", "depen dence in accepting France's overtures for\npeace, when Hamilton, Pickering, King, and all the rest, out of private or party interest\nrather than patriotism, wished war.264  THE UNITED STATES  [18", "00\nToward 1800, Democracy bade fair soon to come into power, but the Federalists\nlearned no wisdom. Rather were they henceforth more factious than ever, opposing\nJefferson and Madison even when they a", "cted on purely federalist principles. Tooth and\nnail they fought against the acquisition of Louisiana, the War of 1812, and the protective\ntariff of 1816, which was carried by Republicans. A worse spi", "rit still was shown in their\ndisunion scheme of 1804, after the purchase of Louisiana, and in the Hartford\nConvention of 1814. Fed eralism had further lost ground by its mean and revolutionary\ndevices", " on resign ing power in 1801, first to make Burr President instead of Jefferson,\nand, failing in this, to use its expiring authority in creating needless offices for its clients.\nIn consequence of suc", "h ill-advised steps, federalist strength waned apace. In 1804\nConnecticut, Delaware, and Maryland alone chose federalist electors, the last only two\nsuch. In 1808 these were joined by the remaining Ne", "w England States, North Carolina\nalso casting three federalist votes. In 1812, indeed, Clinton received eighty-nine votes to\nMadison's one hun dred and twenty-eight; but in 1816 again only Massachuset", "ts,\nConnecticut, and Dela ware were federalist.1800] THE FEDERALIST PARTY 265\nIn 1820 not a State had a federalist majority. State elections in Maryland, North\nCarolina, Delaware, and Connecticut comm", "only went federalist till 1820, and in\nMassachusetts till 1823, when the Republicans swept this common wealth too, Essex\nCounty and all.\nYet Federalism did not die without fix ing its stamp indelibly ", "upon our institu tions.\nNot to mention the Whig and the modern Republican Parties, close reproduc tions of it,\nor the public credit, its child, methods of administration passed with little change from", "\nAdams to Jefferson and his successors, and federalist principles modified the entire\ntemper, and directed in no small degree the action, of the Democratic Party while in\npower. The nation was exalted", " more, state rights subordinated, and the Constitution\nconstrued ever more broadly. Thus there was silently and grad ually imparted to our\ngovernmental fabric a consistency and a solidity which were o", "f incalculable worth\nagainst storms to come.CHAPTER VII.\nTHE WEST\nA simple resolution of the Continental Congress in 1780 has proved of the highest\nconsequence for the subsequent develop ment of our c", "ountry. It declared that all\nterritorial land should be national domain, to be disposed of for the common benefit of\nthe States, with the high privilege of itself growing into States coequal with the ", "old\nThirteen. The treaty of 1783 carried this domain north to the Lakes, west to the\nMississippi. The Ohio divided it into a northwestern and a southwestern part. The land to\nthe west of themselves Vi", "r ginia and North Carolina claimed, and it became Kentucky\nand Tennessee, respec tively, erected into statehood, the one June 1, 1792, the other June\n1, 1796, these being the fifteenth and sixteenth S", "tates in order.1787] THE WEST 267\nVermont, admitted in 1791, was the four teenth. Virginia never released Kentucky till it\nbecame a State.

Arkwright's roller arrangement was an\nimprovement upon Hargreaves'. It bettered the qualit", "y of the threads, making them\nevener, so that they could serve for warp as well as woof. Crompton's mule was another\nquantitative improvement, combining the excellences of both Hargreaves and Arkwrigh", "t.\nOne man could with this machinery work twenty-two hundred spindles, and they went\nmuch faster than by the ancient wheel. Then came steam-power. Watts's engine was\nadapted to spinning and card ing c", "otton at Manchester in 1783. Two years later the\ncylinder printing of cottons was invented, and a little after began the use of acid in\nbleaching.307\nEli Whitney.3081800]  SOCIAL CULTURE 309\nThese mig", "hty industrial devices did not cross to America immediately, but were all\nhere before the time of which we now write. A spinning-jenny was indeed exhibited in\nPhiladelphia so early as 1775. During the", " Revolution, Philadelphia was a seat of much\nmanufacture. We have in an earlier chapter remarked that Beverly, Mass., had a cotton\nfactory in 1787. Oxen furnished its power, as a horse did that for th", "e first Philadelphia\nmill. A cotton mill was also started very early at Worcester, but whether in 1780 or 1789\nmay admit of doubt. There is some evidence that be fore July, 1790, a cotton factory run\n", "by water, with ginning, carding, and spinning machines, the last of eighty-four spindles\napiece, was in operation near Statesburg, S. C.; but whether it was successful or not is\nnot known. Oliver Evan", "s was operating a single-flue boiler for steam-power by 1786.310 THE UNITED STATES  [1800\nSoon after he had one with two flues, and in 1779 a high-pressure or non-condensing\nengine, the principle of w", "hich he is by many believed to have invented. He was the\nearliest builder of steam-engines in the United States, having in 1804 secured a patent\nfor the high-pressure device. His factory furnished eng", "ines to all parts of the country.\nEngland did her best to prevent all knowledge of the new manufacturing ma chinery\nfrom crossing the Atlantic. The Act 21 George III., c. 37, denounced upon anyone who", "\nshould aid toward giving America any tool, machine, or secret re lating to manufacture in\nany branch, a penalty of 200 pounds and one year's imprison ment. In vain. Partly by\nsmuggling, partly by inv", "ention, the new arts soon flourished here as there. Some Scotch\nartisans who came to Bridgewater, Mass., by invitation from Mr. Hugh Orr, of that town,\nconstructed, about 1786, the first cotton-spinni", "ng machines in America, in cluding the\nArkwright inventions.1800] SOCIAL CULTURE  311\nTo build and launch the English machinery with full success was, however, reserved\nfor Samuel Slater, a native of ", "Belper, Derbyshire , England, who, in 1790, erected at\nPawtucket, R. I., the Old Mill in rear of Mill Street, which still stands and runs. Slater\nhad served his time at the making of cotton-manufactur", "ing machinery with J. Strutt,\nwho, had been Arkwright's partner. In Strutt's factory he had risen to be over seer. So\nthoroughly had he mastered the business that, on arriving here, he found himself a", "ble to\nimitate the foreign machines from memory alone, without model, plan, or measurement.\nHaving gotten his gear in readiness, almost solely with his own hands, December 20,\n1790, he started three c", "ards, drawing and roving, also seventy-two spin dles, all on the\nArkwright plan, the first of the kind ever triumphantly operated on this side of the ocean.\nPresident Jack son styled Slater \"the fathe", "r of American manufactures,\" and 1790 may be\ntaken as the birth-year of the American factory system.312 THE UNITED STATES  [1800\nThe Tariff, the embargo policy of President Jefferson, and the hatred t", "oward\nEngland, taking form in organizations pledged to wear only home-made clothing, all\npower fully stimulated the erection of factories. A repor t in 1810, of Albert Gallatin,\nMadi son's Secretary o", "f the Treasury, states that by the end of the year preceding, eighty-\nseven cotton factories had arisen in this country, calculated for eighty thousand spindles.\nThe power loom, however, not used in E", "ngland till about 1806, did not begin its work\nhere till after the War of 1812. [footnote: See. further, Period II., Chap. VIII.]CHAPTER IX.\nDEMOCRACY AT THE HELM\nBy the original mode of election, Pre", "si dent and Vice-President could not be\nseparately designated on electors' tickets, so that, soon as party spirit led each elector to\nvote for the same two men, these two were tied for the first place", ". This occurred in 1801.\nThe republican candidates were Jefferson and Burr. Each had the same number of\nelectoral votes, seventy-three, against sixty-five for Adams, sixty-four for C. C.\nPinckney, and", " one for John Jay. There being no choice, the election went to the House.\nThis had a federalist major ity, but was, by the parity of the two highest candidates,\nconstitutionally shut up to elect betwe", "en these, both of them Republicans. Jefferson as\nthe abler and from the South, was more than Burr an object of federalist hate.314  THE UNITED STATES [1801\nAgainst Hamilton's advice, to his honor be i", "t remembered, the Federalists agreed to\nthrow their votes for Burr. But the vote then, as to-day in such a case, had to be by\nStates. There were sixteen States, nine being necessary to a choice. In ni", "ne teen ballots on\nFebruary 11th, nine the 12th, one the 13th, four the 14th, one each the 16th and 17th,\nthirty-five in all, Jeffer son every time carried eight States and Burr six, while Maryland\nan", "d Vermont were equally divided, and therefore pow erless.\nThe fear at last began to be felt that the Union would go to pieces and the Federal ists\nbe to blame. Accordingly, on the 36th ballot, five Fe", "deralists from South Carolina, four\nfrom Maryland, one from Vermont, and one from Delaware--Mr. Bayard, grandfather to\nPresident Cleveland's first Secretary of State--did not vote, enabling the republ", "ican\nmembers from Vermont and Maryland to cast the votes of those States for Jefferson.\nThus, with ten States, he was elected, Burr becoming Vice-President.315\nThomas Jefferson.\nFrom the painting by G", "ilbert Stuart--property of T. Jefferson Coolidge.3161801] DEMOCRACY AT THE HELM 317\nThis crisis led, in 1804, to the XIIth Amendment to the Constitution, which directs each\nelector to vote for Vice-Pr", "esi dent as such. There can hardly now be a tie between the two\nleading presidential candidates, and if there is for any reason delay in electing the\nPresident, the Senate may proceed to elect the Vic", "e-President at once. The improvement\nbecame manifest when, in 1825, the House again had to elect the President, and chose\nJohn Quincy Adams over Crawford and Jackson.\nThe Democratic Party proved to ha", "ve entered upon a long lease of power. For forty\nyears its hold upon affairs was not relaxed, and it was in no wise broken even by the\nelections of Harrison in 1840 and Taylor in 1848. Nor did it ever", " appear probable that\nthe Whigs, upon anyone of the great issues which divided them from the Democrats,\nwere in a way to win per manent advantage. Not till after 1850 had the ruling dynasty\ntrue reaso", "n to tremble, and then only at the rise of a new party, the modern Republicans,\ninspired by the bold cry of anti-slavery, which the Whigs had never dared to raise.318 THE UNITED STATES  [1801\nAs to it", "s main outlines, the democratic policy was well foreshadowed in Jefferson's\nfirst inaugural. It favored thrift and sim plicity in government, involving close limi tation\nof army, navy, and diplomatic ", "corps to positive and tangible needs. It pro fessed peculiar\nregard for the rights and interests of the common man, whether of foreign or of native\nparentage. Strict con struction of the Constitution,", " which was to a great extent viewed as\na compact of States, was another of its cherished ideas. It also maintained special\nfriendliness for agriculture and commerce. From its strict constructionism sp", "rung,\nfurther, its hostil ity to internal improvements; from this and from its regard to agriculture\nand commerce resulted its dislike to restrictive tariffs. Particularly after the whig schism,\nabout", " 1820, did these ideas stand forth def inite and pronounced as the a uthoritative\ndemocratic creed. In and from Jackson's time they were more so still.1801] DEMOCRACY AT THE HELM 319\nYet in most respe", "cts Jefferson has remained the typical Democrat, He had genuine\nfaith in the people, in free govern ment, in unfettere d individuality, His ad ministration\nwas frugal almost to a fault. He insisted up", "on making the civil power supreme over the\nmilitary, and scorned all pretensions on the part of any particular class to rule, In two\npoints only was his democracy ideal rather than illustrative of tha", "t which followed, viz.,\nadroitness in giv ing trend and consistency to legislation, and non-partisan administration\nof the civil service. In the former no executive has equalled him, in the latter non", "e since\nQuincy Adams.\nGrowing up as a scholar and a gentle man-farmer, with refined tastes, penning the\ngreat Declaration, which was early scouted for its abstractions, long minister to France,\nwhere ", "abstract ideas made all high politics morbid, the sage of Monti cello  turned out to\nbe one of the most practical presidents this nation has ever had.320 THE UNITED STATES [1801\nIf he overdid simplici", "ty in going to the Capitol on horseback to deliver his first\ninaugural, tying his magnificent horse, Wildair , to a tree with his own hands, he yet\nentertained elegantly, and his whole state as Presid", "ent, far from humiliating the nation,\nas some feared it would, was in happy keeping with its then development and nature. His\ncabinet, Madison, Galla tin, Dearborn, Smith, and Granger, was in lib eral", " education\nsuperior to any other the nation has ever had, every member a col lege graduate, and the\nfirst two men of distinguished research and attainments.\nAs to the civil service, Jefferson, it is t", "rue, made many removals from office, some\ndoubtless unwise and even unjust; but in judging of these we must remember his\nprofound and unquestionably honest conviction that the Federalists lacked pa tr", "iotism. It\nwas this belief which dictated his prosecution, almost persecution, of Burr, whom\nFederalists openly befriended and defended.321\nAaron Burr.\nFrom a painting by Vallderlyn at the New York Hi", "storical Society.3221801] DEMOCRACY AT THE HELM 323\nAaron Burr was the brilliant grandson of President Edwards. Graduating at Princeton\nat the early age of seventeen, he studied theology a year, then ", "law, which on the outbreak\nof the Revolution he de serted for army life at Boston. He went in Arnold's expedition to\nCanada, was pro moted to be colonel, and served on Wash ington's staff. In Canada h", "e did\nservice as a spy, disguised as a priest and speaking French or Latin as needed. His legal\nstudies completed, 1783 found him in prac tice in New York, office at No. 10 Little\nQueen Street. Both a", "s lawyer and in pol itics he rose like a meteor, being Hamil ton's peer\nin the one, his superior in the other. Organizing his \"Little Band\" of young Republicans,\nspite of federalist op position and sn", "eers from the old republican chiefs, he became\nAttorney-general of New York in 1789. In 1791, superseding Schuyler, he was United\nStates senator from that State, and in 1800, Vice-President.\nHigher he", " could not mount, as federalist favor cursed him among his own party, yet\nwas too  weak to aid him independently. It was kept down by Hamilton, who saw through\nthe man and opposed him with all his mig", "ht. For this Burr forced him to a duel, and\nfatally shot him, July 11, 1804.324 THE UNITED STATES [1804\nIndicted for murder, Burr now disappears from politics, but only to emerge in a new\nrole. During", " all the early history of our Union the parts beyond the Alleghanies were\nattached to it by but a slender thread, which Spanish intrigue incessantly sought to cut.\nAt this very time Spain was pen sion", "ing men in high station there, including General\nWilkinson, commanding our force at New Orleans. Could not Burr detach this district or\na part of it from our Gov ernment and make here an empire of his", " own? Or might he not\ntake it as the base of operations for an attack on Spanish America that should give him\nan empire there? Some vision of this sort danced before the mad genius's vision, as\nbefore", " that of Hamilton in the Miranda scheme. Many influential persons encouraged\nhim, with how much insight into his plan we shall never know. Wilkinson was one of\nthese. Blennerhassett, whose family and ", "estate Burr irreparably blasted, was another. He\nexpected aid from Great Britain, and from disaffected Mexicans.1806] DEMOCRACY AT THE HELM  325\nFrom the outset the West proved more loyal than he hope", "d, and when, at the crit ical\nmoment, Wilkinson betrayed him, he knew that all was lost. Sinking his chests of arms\nin the river near Natchez, he took to the Mississippi woods, only to be recog nized,", "\narrested by Jefferson's order, and dragged to Richmond to jail. As no overt act was\nproved, he could not be convicted of treason; and even the trial of him for misdemeanor\nbroke down on technical poi", "nts. The Federalists stood up for Burr as if he had been their\nman, while Jeffer son on his part pushed the prosecution in a fussy and personal way, ill\nbecoming a President.\nJefferson's most lasting ", "work as national chief-magistrate was his diplomacy in\npurchasing for the Union the boundless terri tory beyond the Mississippi, prized then not\nfor its extent or resources, both as yet unknown, but a", "s assuring us free navigation of the\nriver, which sundry French and Spanish plots had demonstrated essential to the solid\nloyalty of the West.326 THE UNITED STATES [1801\nLouisiana, ceded by France to ", "Spain in 1762, became French again in 1801. Napoleon\nhad intended it as the seat of a colonial power rivalling Great Britain's, but, pressed for\nmoney in his new war with that kingdom, concluded to se", "ll. He wished, too, the\nfriendship of the United States against Great Britain, and knew not the worth of what he\nwas bargaining away.

The Barbary powers had begun to annoy our commerce soon after\nIndependence. The Betsey was cap tured in 1784, next year the Maria, of Boston, and the\nDauphin, of Philadelphia, and their crews", " of twenty-one men carried to a long and\ndisgraceful captivity in Al giers.\nThe Dey's bill for these captives, held by him as slaves, was:\n3 Captains at $6,000 $18,000\n2 Mates at $4,000 8,000\n2 Passen", "gers at $4,000 8,000\n14 Seamen at $1,400 19,600\n---------\n$53,600\n For custom, eleven per cent 5,896\n---------\n$59,4961801] DEMOCRACY AT THE HELM 329\nLater a single cruise lost us ten vessels to these", " half-civilized people.\nFollowing European precedent, Wash ington had made, in 1795, a ransom-treaty with\nthis nest of pirates, to carry out which cost us a fat million.

Commodore Dale\nwas ordered to the Mediterranean with a squadron to protect our ships there from furth", "er\noutrage.

She\npersisted in l", "oosely defining contraband and blockade, and in denouncing as unlawful all\ncommerce which was opened to us as neutrals merely by war or carried on by us\nbetween France and French colonies through our ", "own ports.\nThe far more flagrant abuse of impress ment , the forcible seizure of American\ncitizens for service in the British navy, became intolerably prevalent during Jefferson's\nadministration. Not ", "content with reclaiming deserters or asserting the eternity of Brit ish\ncitizenship, Great Britain, through her naval authorities, was compelling thousands of\nmen of unquestioned American birth to hel", "p fight her battles.334 THE UNITED STATES  [1807\nCastlereagh himself admitted that there had been sixteen hun dred bona fide cases of this\nsort by January 1, 1811. And in her mode of asserting and exe", "rcising even her just\nclaims she ignored international law, as well as the dig nity and sovereignty of the United\nStates. The odious right of search she most shame fully abused. The narrow seas about\n", "England were assumed to be British waters, and acts performed in American harbors\nadmissible only on the open ocean. When pressed by us for apology or redress, the\nBritish Government showed no serious", " will ingness to treat, but a brazen resolve to\nutilize our weak and too trustful policy of peace.\nOne instance of this shall suffice. Com modore Barron, in command of the United\nStates war vessel Che", "sapeake, was attacked by the Leopard, a British two- decker of fifty\nguns, outside the mouth of Chesa peake Bay, to recover three sailors, falsely alleged to be\nBritish-born, on board.335\nJames Madiso", "n.\nFrom a painting by Gilbert Stuart--property of T.

She\nhad been shamefully unprepared for action, and was hence forced to strike, but\nHumphreys, the Leopard's commander, contemptuous", "ly declined to take her a prize.\nThere was no excuse whatever for this wanton and criminal insult to our flag, yet the\nonly reparation ever made was formal, tardy, and lame.\nBad was changed to worse w", "ith the progress of the new and more desperate war\nbetween Great Britain and Napoleon. The Emperor shut the North-German ports to\nBritain; Britain declared Prussian and all West European harbors in a ", "state of blockade.\nThe Emperor's Berlin decree, November, 1806, paper-blockaded the Brit ish Isles; his\nMilan decree, December, 1807, declared forfeited all vessels, wher ever found,\nproceeding to or ", "from any British port, or having submitted to British search or tribute.338 THE UNITED STATES  [1810\nIn fine, Britain would treat as illicit all commerce with the conti nent, France all with\nBritain. ", "But while Napoleon, in fact, though not avowedly, more and more receded from\nhis posi tion, England ma intained hers with iron tenacity.\nSincere as was our Government's desire to maintain strict neutr", "ality in the Euro pean\nconflict, it naturally found difficulty in making England so believe. Their oppo nents at\nhome ceaselessly charged Jeffer son, Madison,  and all the Republicans with partiality ", "to\nFrance, so that Canning and Castlereagh  were misled; and they were confirmed in their\nsuspicion by Napoleon's crafty assumption that our embargo or non- intercourse policy\nwas meant to act, as it ", "confessedly  did, favorably to France. Na poleon's confiscation of\nour vessels, at one time sweeping, he advertised as a friendly proceeding in aid of our\nembargo. Yet all this did not, as Castlereagh", " captiously pre tended, prove our neutrality\nto be other than strict and honest. At this time it certainly was both. So villainously had\nNapoleon treated us that all Americans now hated him as heartil", "y as did any peo ple in\nEngland.1812] THE WAR OF 1812  339\nThe non-intercourse mode of hostility, a boomerang at best, had played itself out\nbefore Jefferson's retirement; and since George's ministry ", "showed no signs whatever of a\nchanged temper, guiltily ill-prepared as we were, no honorable or safe course lay before\nus but to fight Great Britain. Clay, Calhoun, Quincy Adams, and Monroe-- the last", " the\nsoul of the war--deserved the credit of seeing this first and clearest, and of the most\nsturdy and consistent action accordingly. Their spirit proved infectious, and the\nRepublicans swiftly becam", "e a war party.\nMost of the \"war-hawks,\" as they were derisively styled, were from the South and\nthe southern Middle States. Fearing that, if it were a naval war, glory would redound to\nNew England and", " New York, which were hotbeds of the peace party, they wished this to\nbe a land war, and shrieked, \"On to Canada.\" They made a great mistake.340 THE UNITED STATES [1812\nThe land operations were for th", "e most part indescribably disgraceful. Except the exploits\nof General Brown and Colonel Winfield Scott, subsequently the head of the national\narmies, not an action on the New York border but ingloriou", "sly failed. The national\nCapitol was captured and burnt, a deed not more disgraceful to England in the\ncommission than to us in the permission. Of the officers in com mand of armies, only\nHarrison and", " Jackson earned laurels.\nHarrison had learned warfare as Governor of Indiana, where, on November 7, 1811,\nhe had fought the battle of Tippe canoe , discomfiting Tecumseh's braves and\npermanently quiet", "ing Indian hostilities throughout that territory. In the new war against\nEngland, after Hull's pusil lanimous surrender of Detroit, the West loudly and at length\nwith success demanded \" Tippecanoe\" as", " commander for the army about to advance into\nCanada. Their esti mate of Harrison proved just. Overcoming ma ny difficulties and aided\nby Perry's flotilla on Lake Erie, he pursued Proctor, his retreat", "ing British antagonist, up\nthe River Thames to a point beyond Sandwich.1812] THE WAR OF 1812  341\nTecumseh\nHere the British made a stand, but a gallant charge of Harrison's Kentucky cavalry\nirreparabl", "y broke their lines. The Indians, led by old Tecumseh in person, made a better\nfight, but in vain. The victory was complete, and Upper Canada lay at our mercy.342 THE UNITED STATES [1812\nAndrew Jackso", "n also began his military experience by operations against Indians.\nThe southern redskins had been incited to war upon us by British and Spanish emissaries\nalong the Florida line. Tecum seh had visite", "d them in the same interest. The horrible\nmassacre at Fort Mims, east of the Alabama above its junction with the Tombigbee, was\ntheir initial work. Five hundred and fifty persons were there surprised,", " four hundred of\nthem slain or burned to death. Jackson took the field, and in an energetic campaign, with\nseveral bloody engagements, forced them to peace. By the battle of the Horse-Shoe,\nMarch 27, ", "1814, the Creek power was entirely crushed.\nSubsequently placed in command of our force at New Orleans, Jackson was attacked\nby a numerous British army, made up in large part of veterans who had seen ", "service\nunder Wellington in Spain. Pakenham, the hero of Salamanca, commanded. Jack son's\nposition was well chosen and strongly fortified.1812] THE WAR OF 1812  343\nAfter several preliminary engagemen", "ts, each favorable to the American arms, Pakenham\nessayed to carry the American works by storm. The battle occurred on January 8, 1815.\nIt was des perately fought on both sides, but at its close Jacks", "on's loss had been trifling\nand his line had not been broken at a single point, while the British had lost at least\n2,600, all but 500 of these killed or wounded. The British immediately withdrew from", "\nthe Mississippi, leaving Jackson entirely master of the position.\nBut the naval operations of this war were far the most famous, exceeding in their\nsuccess all that the most sanguine had dared to hop", "e, and forever dispelling from our\nproud foe the charm of naval invinci bility. The American frigate Constitution captured\nthe British Guerriere. The Wasp took the Frolic, being soon, however, forced ", "to\nsurrender with her prize to the Poitiers, a much larger vessel. The United States\nvanquished the Macedonian, and the Con stitution the Java. One of the best fought\nactions of the war was that of Mc", "Donough on Lake Champlain, with his craft mostly\ngunboats or galleys. His victory restored to us the possession of Northern New York,\nwhich our land forces had not been able to maintain.344 THE UNITED", " STATES  [1813\nOliver H. Perry.\nThe crowning naval triumph during the war, one of the most brilliant, in fact, in all\nnaval annals, was won by Oliver Hazard Perry near Put-in-Bay on Lake Erie, Sep tem", "ber\n10, 1813, over the Briton, Barclay, a naval veteran who had served under Nelson at\nTrafalgar.1813]  THE WAR OF I812 345 \nThe fleets were well matched, the American numbering the more vessels but t", "he fewer\nguns. Barclay greatly exceeded Perry in long guns, hav ing the latter at painful\ndisadvantage until he got near. Perry's flag-ship, the Law rence, was early disabled. Her\ndecks were drenched ", "with blood, and she had hardly a gun that could be served.\nUndismayed, Perry, with his insignia of command, crossed in a little boat to the Niagara.\nAgain proudly hoisting his colors, aided by the win", "d and followed by his whole\nsquadron, he pressed for close quarters, where desperate fighting speedily won the battle.\nBarclay and his next in command were wounded, the latter dying that night. \"We ha", "ve\nmet the enemy and they are ours,\" Perry wrote to Harrison, \"two ships, two brigs, one\nschooner, and one sloop.\"346  THE UNITED STATES  [1813\nTriumph far more complete might have attended the war bu", "t for the perverse and\nfactious federalist opposition to the admin istration. Some Federalists favored joining\nEngland out and out against Napoleon. Having with justice denounced Jefferson's\nembargo t", "actics as too tame, yet when the war spirit rose and even the South stood ready\nto resent foreign affronts by force, they changed tone, harping upon our weak ness and\nfavoring peace at any price.
